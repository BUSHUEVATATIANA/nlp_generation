7," no!! okay?! why does everyone keep fixating on that? she didn't know, how should i know?", sometimes i wish i was a lesbian... (they all stare at him.) did i say that out loud?
8," i don't want to be single, okay? i just... i just- i just wanna be married again!", and i just want a million dollars! (he extends his hand hopefully.)

22, shut up!, tell me what?
23, that only took me an hour.," look, ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento.   you, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  i don't think that was my point!"

39," yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket."," the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? i mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
40, pregnant?!," oh, i think this is the episode of three's company where there's some kind of misunderstanding."
41, whose little ball of paper is this?!," oh, uh, that would be mine. see, i wrote a note to myself, and then i realised i didn't need it, so i balled it up and... (sees that monica is glaring at him) ...now i wish i was dead."
42," look , i'm sorry, guys, i just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have."," yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow."

45, doy! probably right before she lost it!, you don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
46," i know i had it this morning, and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with...", ...dinah?

53, what are we supposed to be seeing here?," i dunno, but.. i think it's about to attack the enterprise."
54," since always. it's like dating language. y'know, like 'it's not you' means 'it is you'.", or 'you're such a nice guy' means 'i'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
55, yeah. cushions the blow.," yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm."

59," ""i just wanna go back to my cell. 'cause in my cell, i can smoke."""," ""smoke away.""  i think this is probably why damone smokes in his cell alone."
60, whoah!, hey!
61, hey!," honey, i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend."
62," no no no, i am not giving you a cigarette."," it's fine, it's fine. look, do you wanna get this part, or not? here.  don't think of it as a cigarette. think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. when you're holding it, you feel right. you feel complete."
63, y'miss it?," nah, not so much. alright, now we smoke. (takes a puff.) oh.. my.. god. (he continues to smoke.)"
64, - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.," oh, satan's minions at work again..."
65, what is this?!," i'm smoking. i'm smoking, i'm smoking."
66," oh, i can't believe you! you've been so good, for three years!", and this- is my reward!
67," hold on a second, alright? just think about what you went through the last time you quit."," okay, so this time i won't quit!"

73," i know! i know, i opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!"," well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? like, collect all five?"
74, it's worse than the thumb!," hey, this is so unfair!"
75," oh, why is it unfair?"," so i have a flaw! big deal! like joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? and monica, with that snort when she laughs? i mean, what the hell is that thing? ...i accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
76, don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?," hey, y'know, i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. the bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
77," (holding the phone out to chandler) chandler? it's alan, he wants to speak to you."," really? he does? (taking the phone) hey, buddy, what's up! oh, she told you about that, huh. well, yeah, i have one now and then. well, yeah, now. well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. well, okay, thanks!

78, yeah.," yeah. well, i think our second fight is going to be a big one!"
79, (entering) hey. where's joey?," joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him. do you think that was wrong?"
80, (finishing changing chandler's nicotine patch) there y'go.," (deadpan) ooh, i'm alive with pleasure now."
81, i'm sorry..," (sarcastic) oh, she's sorry! i feel better!"
82," you had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (she sits down and ross strokes her forehead.)", ...that's it. i'm getting cigarettes.
83, no no no!," (leaving) i don't care, i don't care! game's over! i'm weak! i've gotta smoke! i've gotta have the smoke!"

85," yeah, see.. you took mine. chandler, what about you?"," uh, if i were omnipotent for a day, i'd.. make myself omnipotent forever."
86," ...ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. see, i told you! less than a hundred steps from our place to here.", you got waaaay too much free time.
87," (to ross) hey! here's the birthday boy! ross, check it out: hockey tickets, rangers-penguins, tonight at the garden, and we're taking you."," happy birthday, pal!"
88," so, i'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?"," well, aren't we mr. ""the glass is half empty."""

93," god, isn't this exciting? i earned this. i wiped tables for it, i steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens envelope)—not worth it. who's fica? why's he getting all my money? i mean, what- chandler, look at that."," (looking) oh, this is not that bad."
94," (to monica) look, look, i have elbows! (they scream.)", ...poulet passes it up to leetch! (passes it to joey.)
95," leetch spots messier in the crease- there's the pass! (he kicks it to ross, but ross is staring into a shop window.)", we'll take a brief time out while messier stops to look at some women's shoes.

103," oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (yelling) hey, that's not for you, bitch!

104, i remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.," yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- could i get some painkillers over here, please?"
105," look, it's just a little more complicated..."," well, what? what? what is it? that she left you? that she likes women? that she left you for another woman that likes women?"
106," little louder, okay, i think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...", then what?
107, with carol? (ross gives him a look.) oh.," so in your whole life, you've only been with one—(he gets a look too)—oh."

109, really?," no, you kidding? the guy's a freak.. (ross enters off camera)"
110," (sarcastic) oh, that's attractive."," oh, i thought you were great in silence of the lambs. oh come on, admit it! all things considered, you had fun tonight."

118," no plans, huh?", not a one.
119," not even, say, breaking up with janice?"," oh, right, right, shut up."
120," chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. you just gotta do it."," no, i know, but it's just so hard, you know? i mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
121," you know, if you want, i'll do it with you."," oh, thanks, but i think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her."
122," yeah, well, it's a mercedes if i move back home. oh, it was horrible. he called me young lady."," ooh, i hate when my father calls me that."

128," ok, ok, now what is wrong with my snuggles? what, it says i'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. ok, i can pick something else up on the way.", there you go.
129, ...horribly attractive. i'll be shutting up now., where are they? where are they?
130, this is nice. we never do anything just the two of us., it's great. maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
131," eww, i don't wanna do that.", here we go.
132," ok, have a good break-up."," hey, janice."
133," oh, my god, i am so glad you called me. i had the most supremely awful day."," hey, that's not good. can i get an espresso and a latte over here, please?"
134," we got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, i blew off the rest of the day, and i went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and i got you, i'm looking, i'm looking, i'm looking, i got you...", what?
135, i got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks), bullwinkle socks. that's so sweet.

137," (holding the full cup) no, no, i'm still working on mine.", that's it?
138," yeah, it was really hard."," oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
139," ok, you can do this. it's just like pulling off a band-aid. just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed."," janice. hi, janice. ok, here we go. i don't think we should go out anymore. janice."
140," uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here."," here's the thing, janice. you know, i mean, it's like we're different. i'm like the bing, bing, bing. you're like the boom, boom, (chandler flails his hand out and hits janice in the eye)... boom."

143, oh my god. (chandler downs another espresso.) how many of those have you had?," oh, i don't know, a million?"
144," chandler, easy, easy. go to your happy place. la la la la la la la.", i'm fine.

152, oh. hel-lo!," she's amazing! she makes the women that i dream about look like short, fat, bald men!"
153," well, go over to her! she's not with anyone."," oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'excuse me. blarrglarrghh.'"
154," oh, c'mon. she's a person, you can do it!"," oh please, could she be more out of my league? ross, back me up here."

164," ...luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. so, we made it to the border, but just barely, and i- ...i've been talking about myself all night long, i'm sorry. what about you? tell me one of your stories."," alright. once i got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and i rode it all the way to brooklyn... just for the hell of it.  we talked 'til like two. it was this perfect evening... more or less."

172, oh. i'm sorry it didn't work out., what 'not work out'? i'm seeing her again on thursday. didn't you listen to the story?
173," didn't you listen to the story? i mean, this is twisted! how could you get involved with a woman like this?"," well, y'know, i had some trouble with it at first too, but the way i look at it is, i get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. i mean, this is every guy's fantasy!"
174, tah-daaah!, are we greeting each other this way now? 'cause i like that.
175, (to rachel) i can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.," thank god you didn't try to fan out the magazines. i mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out."
176, why would someone do that?! ...one might wonder.," someone's left a glass on the coffee table. there's no coaster. it's a cold drink, it's a hot day. little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood..."
177," c'mon, you guys. this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it, and that's big!"," oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness."
178, thank you! (he goes into the bathroom.), where's joey? his mom's on the phone.
179, he's in the bathroom. i don't think you wanna go in there!," c'mon, we're roommates! (he goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) my eyes!! my eyes!!"
180, who is being loud?," oh, that would be monica. hey, listen, i wanna borrow a coupla things, aurora spent the night, i really wanna make her breakfast."
181," oh, you got the whole night, huh?"," yeah, well, i only have twenty minutes until ethan, so, y'know.. (he starts to raid the fridge.)"
182," ooh, do i sense a little bit of resentment?"," no, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'kay? y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? well, every- single- second is like that with aurora.. and i've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. monica, can you help me with the door? (he has armloads of stuff.)"
183, i was going for quiet desperation. but if you have to ask...," god, i love these fingers..."
184, thank you.," no, actually i meant my fingers. look at 'em, look at how happy they are."
185," (moves chandler's arm and look at his watch.) oh my god, i'm late. (she starts to get up.)"," oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (he kisses her and pulls her back down.)"
186, okay., (entering) bob. bob! bob!!! (he turns around) what the hell are you doing?!
187," okay. oh no, i have to."," (to himself) too bad, she's leaving."
188, (getting up and dressing) i'm sorry. he'll be waiting for me.," well, i thought- i thought you talked to rick."
189, it's not rick.," what, ethan? he got to spend the whole day with you!"
190," no, it's-it's andrew."," i know there'll be many moments in the years to come when i'll regret asking the following question, but- and andrew is?"
191, he's... new.," oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by rick, ethan and myself?"
192," no, that's not exactly what i was.."," well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us."
193, so what do you want?, you.
194, you have me!," nono, just you."
195, whaddyou mean?, lose the other guys.
196," ...like, ...all of them?"," c'mon, we're great together, why not?"
197," why can't we just have what we have now? why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight i thought that's what you wanted too."," ...well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like i'm two guys, y'know? i mean, one guy's going 'shut up! this is great!' but there's this other guy. actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... and he's saying, y'know, 'this is too hard! get out! get out!'"
198, so... which one of the two guys will you listen to?," i don't know, i-i have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish..."
199, which one?, ...the second guy.
200," (gets up to leave) well, call me if you change your mind."," sorry, the first guy runs the lips."
201," no? what happened, big guy?"," (to ross) ""big guy?"""
202, my mom will., something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
203," hi. um, i want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. ok, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights go out) ok, thank you very much."," oh, great. this is just..."
204," can i borrow the phone? i want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. (to monica) what's my number?  well, i never call me."," oh my god, it's that victoria's secret model. something... something goodacre."
205," (on phone) hi mom, it's jill."," she's right, it's jill. jill goodacre. oh my god. i am trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre! (pause) is it a vestibule? maybe it's an atrium. oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!"
206," (on phone) yeah, i'm fine. i'm just stuck at the bank, in an atm vestibule.", jill says vestibule... i'm going with vestibule.
207," (on phone) i'm fine. no, i'm not alone... i don't know, some guy."," oh! some guy. some guy. 'hey jill, i saw you with some guy last night. yes, he was some guy."
208, that had to hurt!," alright, alright, alright. it's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. oh god, do something. just make contact, smile!  there you go!  you're definitely scaring here."
209, (awkwardly) would you like to call somebody? (offering phone),"yeah, about 300 guys i went to high school with. yeah, thanks. (takes phone)"
210, hello?," hey, it's me."
211, (to everyone) it's chandler! (on phone) are you ok?," yeah, i'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) i'm trppd in an atm vstbl wth jll gdcr.  i'm trppd... in an atm vstbl... wth jll gdcr!"
212, i have no idea what you just said., (angry) put joey on the phone.
213, what's up man?, i'm trppd... in an atm vstbl... wth jll gdcr.
214," (to everyone) oh my god! he's trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre! (on phone) chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)"," yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
215, would you like some gum?," um, is it sugarless?"
216," (checks) sorry, it's not."," oh, then no thanks. what the hell was that? mental note: if jill goodacre offers you gum, you take it. if she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it."
217, (nonchalantly) yeah?," you know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'gum would be perfection'? 'gum would be perfection.' could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'i'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. for me, gum is perfection. i loathe myself."
218, (smiling) you betcha!," (chewing gum) ah, let's see. what next? blow a bubble. a bubble's good. it's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. here we go.  nice going, imp. ok, it's ok. all i need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)  good save! we're back on track, and i'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. this is not my gum. oh my god! oh my god! and now you're choking."
219," are you alright?  my god, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the heimlich, the gum flies from his mouth) that better?", (gasping) yes... thank you. that was... that was....
220," chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! now watch, it's easy.", ok.
221," well, this has been fun."," yes. yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life."
222," well, goodbye chandler. i had a great blackout. (she kisses him on the cheek) see ya.","hi, um, i'm account number 7143457. and, uh, i don't know if you got any of that, but i would really like a copy of the tape."
223," hey gorgeous, how's it going?", dehydrated japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
224," question. you're not dating anybody, are you, because i met somebody who would be perfect for you."," ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
225, do you want a date saturday?, yes please.
226," okay. he's cute, he's funny, he's-", he's a he?
227," well yeah! ...oh god. i- just- i thought- good, shelley. i'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) okay, goodbye..."," ...couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. i mean, is that ridiculous? can you believe she actually thought that?"
228," um... yeah. well, i mean, when i first met you, y'know, i thought maybe, possibly, you might be...", you did?
229," yeah, but then you spent phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then i figured maybe not."," huh. did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?"
230," nono, me neither. although, uh, y'know, back in college, susan sallidor did.", you're kidding! did you tell her i wasn't?
231," no. no, it's just 'cause, uh, i kinda wanted to go out with her too, so i told her, actually, you were seeing bernie spellman... who also liked her, so..."," well, this is fascinating. so, uh, what is it about me?"
232," i dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."," ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
233, yeah! right!, what is it?!
234, yes. absolutely. a quality.," oh, oh, a quality, good, because i was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this."
235, now she's passed.," i just have to know, okay. is it my hair?"
236, i'd like that.," hey, gorgeous."
237," (sheepish) hey. look, i'm sorry about yesterday, i, um-"," no, nono, don't- don't worry about it. believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake."
238, oh! okay! phew!," so, uh... what do you think it is about me?"
239," i dunno, uh... you just have a-a..."," ...quality, right, great."
240," y'know, it's a shame, because you and lowell would've made a great couple."," lowell? financial services' lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
241, what? he's cute!," well, yeah... 's'no brian in payroll."
242, is brian...?," no! uh, i d'know! the point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, i'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."
243," well, i think brian's a little out of your league.", excuse me? you don't think i could get a brian? because i could get a brian. believe you me. ...i'm really not.
244, (entering with chandler) morning. we ready to go?," well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...it's stuff like that, isn't it?"
245," it really was. oh, c'mere, sweetheart. (hugs her) y'know, i think it might be time for you to start using night cream."," nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like brent mussberger."
246," check it out, giants-cowboys. (he has a pocket tv)", you're watching a football game at a funeral?
247," no, it's the pre-game. i'm gonna watch it at the reception."," you are a frightening, frightening man."
248," here, sweetie, here. i took these when i had my golfing accident. (hands ross a bottle of pills. then turns to monica and pats her hair over her ears)"," oh, no-"
249," sorry- hi, i'm dorothy's daughter."," hi, i'm chandler, and i have no idea who dorothy is."
250, ...chandler!, hey.
251," yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. can we be grown-ups now?", who are those people?
252," (looking) nono, that would be me again. i'm, uh, just trying something."," hey, lowell."
253," hey, chandler.", so how's it going there in financial services?
254, it's like mardi gras without the paper mache heads. how 'bout you?," good, good. listen, heh, i dunno what shelley told you about me, but, uh... i'm not."
255, i know. that's what i told her., really.
256," pretty much, most of the time. we have a kind of... radar."," so you don't think i have a, a quality?"
257," speaking for my people, i'd have to say no. by the way, your friend brian from payroll, he is.", he is?
258," yup, and waaay out of your league. (exits)"," out of my league. i could get a brian. (brian enters behind him) if i wanted to get a brian, i could get a brian. (sees him) hey, brian."
259, hey., hey. where've you been?
260," yes, i am. as of today, i am officially joey tribbiani, actor slash model."," that's so funny, 'cause i was thinking you look more like joey tribbiani, man slash woman."
261," you know, the asthma guy was really cute.", do you know which one you're gonna be?
262," no, but i hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)"," good luck, man. i hope you get it."
263," and i assume, chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays."," yes, every single one of them."
264," absolutely. shoop, shoop, shoop. only a hundred and two dollars to go.",i thought it was $98.50.
265," oh, i believe it. i think the baby can totally hear everything. i can show you. look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."," i'd just like to say that i'm totally behind this experiment. in fact, i'd very much like to butter your head."
266," wait, wait, chandler, this is what you're havin' for thanksgiving dinner? what, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"," all right, i'm nine years old."
267," oh, i hate this story."," we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner. i have--and i remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
268, oh my god.," varrrrrroom! hey! watch it lady! varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) hey-hey good lookin’! (honks the bed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) varrrrrrrrroom. (notices rachel and stops) all right, i’ll leave. my bed’s so boring."
269, set another place for thanksgiving. my entire family thinks i have vd.," tonight, on a very special blossom."
270," i got the tickets! i got the tickets! five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop."," oh, you must stop shooping."
271," chandler, will you just come in already?"," no, i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment."
272," look out, incoming pumpkin pie!"," ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore."
273," ok, good-bye you guys. thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) oh, sorry! oh, sorry!", the most unbelievable thing has happened. underdog has just gotten away.
274, the balloon?," no, no, the actual cartoon character. of course the balloon. it's all over the news. right before he reached macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park. i'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?"
275," i can't, i gotta go.",come on. an 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. how often does that happen?
276," no, no, no, you said, ""got the keys"".", do either of you have the keys?
277, why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?, (sarcastic) for an emergency just like this.
278," why? because everything is my responsibility? isn't it enough that i'm making thanksgiving dinner for everyone? you know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so i'm making different kinds of potatoes. does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want? nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions, and mario gets his tots, and it's my first thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and i... i..."," ok, monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. here we go."
279," stop it, stop it, stop it!", now this feels like thanksgiving.
280, it's nice that he has someone., shall i carve?
281, by all means.," ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?"
282, the bigger half.," i'd like to propose a toast. little toast here, ding ding. i know this isn't the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked."
283, and a crappy new year.," here, here!"
284, that is so cruel! why? why would a parent name their child bethel?," hey, that monkey's got a ross on its ass!"
285," so you guys, i'm doing all new material tonight. i have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.", might wanna open with the snowman.
286," hey, do you guys know what you're doing for new year's? (they all protest and hit her with cushions) gee, what?! what is wrong with new year's?"," nothing for you, you have paolo. you don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! man, i'm talking loud!"
287," yeah, you wish!"," it's just that i'm sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday. i say this year, no dates, we make a pact. just the six of us- dinner."
288," yeah, okay. alright."," y'know, i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm."
289," well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while i'm playing, then i assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!"," (quietly, to the others) that guy's going home with a note!"
290," well, he's kinda like the guy i went to see that with. except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... i just- i just wanna be with him all the time. day and night, and night and day... and special occasions..."," wait a minute, wait a minute, i see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to new year's, aren't you. you're gonna break the pact. she's gonna break the pact."
291," no, no, no, no, no, no. yeah, could i just?"," yeah, 'cause i already asked janice."
292," c'mon, this was a pact! this was your pact!"," i snapped, okay? i couldn't handle the pressure and i snapped."
293," yeah, but janice? that-that was like the worst breakup in history!"," i'm not saying it was a good idea, i'm saying i snapped!"
294," hi. hi, sorry i'm late.", too many jokes... must mock joey!
295," nice shoes, huh? (he wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)"," aah, y'killing me!"
296," i didn't wanna leave him alone. alright? we- we had our first fight this morning. i think it has to do with my working late. i said some things that i didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces..."," y'know, if you're gonna work late, i could look in on him for you."
297," oh, that'd be great! okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."," okay, but if he asks, i'm not going to lie."
298," i'm sorry, okay. it's just that chandler has somebody, and phoebe has somebody- i thought i'd ask fun bobby.", fun bobby? your ex-boyfriend fun bobby?
299, you know more than one fun bobby?, i happen to know a fun bob.
300," oh, it's-it's marcel. he keeps shutting me out, y'know? he's walking around all the time dragging his hands..."," that's so weird, i had such a blast with him the other night."
301, really.," yeah, we played, we watched tv.. that juggling thing is amazing."
302," what, uh... what juggling thing?"," with the balled-up socks? i figured you taught him that.  y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. he just balled up socks... and a melon..."
303," i love this artichoke thing! oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! (laughs her janice laugh)", you remember janice.
304," (startles them) there you are! haaah, you got away from me!", (imitating) but you found me!
305," here, ross, take our picture. (hands him a camera and he starts snapping) smile! you're on janice camera!", kill me. kill me now.
306," (ross is still taking their photo) oh, i'm gonna blow this one up, and i'm gonna write 'reunited' in glitter."," alright, janice, that's it! janice... janice... hey, janice, when i invited you to this party i didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-"
307," oh, no. oh, no.", i'm sorry you misunderstood...
308," oh my god. you listen to me, chandler, you listen to me. one of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (she runs off)"," oh, will you give me the thing. (snatches the camera)"
309," there y'go, kids.", (to a woman who he has clearly just met) and then the peacock bit me. (laughs) please kiss me at midnight. (she leaves)
310, you seen sandy?," ooh. uh, i don't know how to tell you this, but she's in monica's bedroom, getting it on with max, that scientist geek. ooh, look at that, i did know how to tell you."
311, (on tv) in twenty seconds it'll be midnight..., and the moment of joy is upon us.
312, not everybody's happy. hey bobby!," y'know, i uh.. just thought i'd throw this out here. i'm no math whiz, but i do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (makes kiss noise)"
313, perfect. perfect. so now everybody's getting kissed but me.," alright, somebody kiss me. somebody kiss me, it's midnight! somebody kiss me!"
314, i wish all guys could be like him., are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
315," (on tv) folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'euphoria unbound': the always interesting nora tyler bing. you might wanna put the kids to bed for this one."," y'know, we don't have to watch this. weekend at bernie's is on showtime, hbo, and cinemax."
316," c'mon, she's your mom!"," exactly. weekend at bernie's! dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! no?"
317," chandler, i gotta tell you, i love your mom's books! i love her books! i cannot get on a plane without one! i mean, this is so cool!","yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'mistress bitch.'"
318," c'mon, chandler, i love your mom. i think she's a blast.", you can say that because she's not your mom.
319, your mom was arrested?," shhh, busy beaming with pride."
320," (on tv) ...this is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after i've been intimate with a man...", now why would she say that's embarrassing?
321, (on tv) ...i just get this craving for kung pow chicken., that's too much information!!
322, awww!, this is the way that i find out. most moms use the phone.
323," (on tv) oh no, i am a fabulous mom! i bought my son his first condoms.", ...and then he burst into flames.
324, i am famished. what do i want... (looks at chandler's menu), please god don't let it be kung pow chicken.
325," oh, you watched the show! what'd you think?"," well, i think you need to come out of your shell just a little."

327," oh, please, honey, listen, if i can do it, anybody can. you just start with half a dozen european cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! you have got yourself a book."," myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen."
328," you don't kiss your friend's mom! sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!", what are you guys doing out here?
329," yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size."," okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (goes back inside and shuts the door)"
330," really? not even to, um, change his pajamas?! (whips back the sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)", oh my god.
331, you're my friend. i-i had to tell you., i can't believe it. paolo kissed my mom?
332," yeah, um, i don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (he has caught sight of joey scowling at him) i can't do this, i did it, it was me, i'm sorry, i kissed your mom.  i was really upset about rachel and paolo, and i think i had too much tequila, and nora- um, mrs. mom- your bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- but nothing happened, nothing- ask joey, joey, uh, came in-", (to joey) you knew about this?
333," uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."," i spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!"
334," thanks, man, big help.", (to ross) i can't believe this! what the hell were you thinking?
335," i wasn't- i mean, i-"," y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap i go through with my mom more than you."
336, i know-, i can't believe you did this. (walks toward the door)

342," okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?"," because it's complicated, it's complex- hey, you kissed my mom!"
343, (to the rest of central perk) we're rehearsing a greek play., that's very funny. we done now?
344," no! okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?"," that would be no. look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. alright? trust me, you can't talk to her."
345," car's waiting downstairs, i just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. anything you want from lisbon?"," no, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."

356, i know...," (to ross) ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!"
357," i love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands..."," ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!"
358, need a new table., you think?
359," (on intercom) uh, never mind, i don't want to know. (carol and susan laugh)"," ok, so it's just because it was my table, i have to buy a new one?"
360, that's the rule.," what rule? there's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
361, how'd you get to that?," well, i believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with angela delvecchio"
362, you knew about that?," well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
363," ok, ok, how about if we split it?"," what do you mean, like, buy it together?"
364, yeah, you think we're ready for something like that?
365, why not?," honestly? our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. now monica and i have been immunized, but sadly you have not."
366," why, are you moving out?", i'm not moving out.
367, you'd tell me if you were moving out right," yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate kip..."
368," aw, i know all about kip!"," it's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
369," well, let me ask you something, was kip a better roommate than me?"," aw, don't do that"
370,"hey, chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.", fine. (joey and chandler walk towards the door)
371," whoa, store will be open tomorrow!"," more coffee over here, please!"

374," will you pick one, just pick one! here, how about that one? (points to a table)", that's patio furniture!
375," so what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""uh-oh, i'm outside again?"" of course!", (gesturing towards another table) what about the birds?
376," i don't know, birds just don't say, ""hello, sit here, eat something.""", you pick one.
377," all right, how about the ladybugs?"," oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!"
378," fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"," not like that, i won't! (pauses) kip would have liked the birds! (joey turns and gives chandler a dirty look)"
379, paolo made a pass at me.," so, what do you think?"
380, i think it's the most beautiful table i've ever seen., i know!
381," come on, two on one."," what are you still doing here? she just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!"
382," yes, now is when you swoop! you gotta make sure that when paolo walks out of there, the first guy rachel sees is you, she's gotta know that you're everything he's not! you're like, like the anti-paolo!"," my catholic friend is right. she's distraught. you're there for her. you pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of ross! (ross and chandler look off into the distance. joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)"
383," i'm having a boy! oh, i'm having a boy!", wha-
384,"uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!"," yeah, get out!"
385," you guys are always hanging out in my apartment! come on, i'll only use my left hand, huh? come on, wussies! (joey and chandler pick her up) all right, ok, i gotta go. i'm going, (they throw her out) and i'm gone.", (to joey) one more game?
386," that is it! you just barge in here, you don't knock", i'm sorry!

388," no, you wait! this is ridiculous!", can i just say one thing?
389, what? what?!, that's a relatively open weave and i can still see your... nipular areas.
390," okaaay. (to the guys, on the couch) any of you guys want anything else?"," oh, yes, could i have one of those. (points)"
391," no, i'm sorry, we're all out of those. anybody else?", okay.
392," did i, uh, did i miss something?"," no, she's still upset because i saw her boobies."
393, you what? wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?, it was an accident. not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
394," okay, pheebs, i was hoping for more of a change."," y'know, i don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies."
395," nice? they were nice. i mean, that's it? i mean, mittens are nice."," okaaay, (gestures) rock, hard place, me."
396, you're so funny! he's really funny! i wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.," whoah whoah, back up there, sparky. what'd you mean by that?"
397," oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.", huh.
398," i mean hey! i just met you, i don't know you from adam. ...only child, right? parents divorced before you hit puberty."," uhhuh, how did you know that?"
399," i know, i mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (she walks over near chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) why do they have to become people? why do they have... (notices chandler) why can't you stop staring at my breasts?", (without looking up) what? (looks up) what?
400," alright, alright. we're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. since you saw her boobies, i think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee."," y'know, i don't see that happening?"
401," c'mon, he's right. tit for tat.", well i'm not showing you my 'tat.'
402, c'mon up.," (sarcastic) oh, good. rog is here."
403, what's the matter with rog?," oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... i hate that guy."
404," night, you guys."," oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
405," oh no, not you, big joey. oh my god, you're so much cuter than your pictures! (joey stares at her) i-i'm, i'm ronni....cheese nip?"," uh, joey's having an embolism, but i'd go for a nip, y'know?"
406," now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. but occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. like, chasing their tail, (demonstrates) or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee."," joey, if i go first, i wanna be looking for my keys."
407, thank you. uh...," so, who's up for a big game of kerplunk?"
408," thanks. you're, uh, you're a good kid."," c'mon, i'll show you to my room. ...that sounds so weird when it's not followed by ""no thanks, it's late."""
409, i don't wanna hear it! now go to my room!," hey, kicky. what're you doing?"
410, just trying to get comfortable. i can't sleep in my underwear.," well, you're gonna."
411," i've been thinking. y'know, about how i'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."," are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
412," y'know what i mean, about how i'm always going out with all these women. and i always figured, when the right one comes along, i'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? now i'm looking at my dad, thinking..."," hey, you're not him. you're you. when they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
413, you really think so?, yeah. i really do.
414," thanks, chandler. (snuggles up to him)", get off!
415, i thought it was chandler!, (comes out of his room) what? what?
416, you were supposed to be in there so i could see your thing!," sorry, my my thing was in there with me."
417," i dunno, there's just something about...", basically we just feel that he's...
418," yeah. he's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today.", things sure have changed here on waltons mountain.
419," just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them."," if i turn into my parents, i'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... i'll end up like my mom."
420, she barely knows me. we just live in the same building., any contact?
421, hey. (stutters something incoherent)," come on, ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? the rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—i don't think we need a third..."
422," yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""here's your egg back, i'm returning your egg.""", i think it's winning.
423, i think it's insane.," she'll love it. go with the egg, my friend."
424, think it'll work?," no, it's suicide. the man's got an egg."
425," actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."," oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
426," no, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. the only reason she's goin' out with me is because i said i could bring a friend for her friend."," yes, i know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
427, hi. she said yes.," yes! way to go, man! (chandler and ross hug. something crunches in ross' shirt pocket.) still got the egg, huh?"
428, (looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) how do i look?," oh, uh, i... don't... care. (joey's date shows up) ok, now, remember, no trading. you get the pretty one, i get the mess."
429," hi, joey. well well, look what you brought. very nice.", ...and what did you bring?
430," she's checking the coats. joey, i'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. will you get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for janice.", janice?
431, oh.... my.... god.," (angrily) hey, it's janice.  ok, i'm makin' a break for it, i'm goin' out the window."
432," no, no, no, don't! i've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with lorraine. just calm down.", calm down? calm down? you set me up with the woman that i've dumped twice in the last five months!
433," (at the urinal) can you stop yellin'? you're makin' me nervous, and i can't go when i'm nervous."," i'm sorry, i'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind joey and yells in his ear) come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"
434," by the way, chandler. i cut you out of all my pictures. so if you want, i have a bag with just your heads.", that's ok.
435, (to lorraine) we can't do that., (disgusted) what? what can't you do?
436," uh, can i talk to you for a second, over there?  uh, we might be leaving now."," tell me it's ""you and me"" we."
437," she said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. i'm not even sure what slathering is, but i definitely want to be a part of it."," ok, you can not do this to me."
438," i'm outta here. here's my credit card. dinner's on me. i'm sorry, chandler.", i hope she throws up on you.  so...
439, just us.," oh, what a crappy night!"
440," although, i have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom."," excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) how ya doin'?"
441," so, do we have the best friends or what?", joey's not a friend. he's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. another drink? some dessert? a big screen tv?
442, i will go for that drink.," you got it. good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?"
443, each.," that's right, each. oh, and a uh rob roy. (to janice) i've always wanted to know..."
444," happy valentine's day!  oh, i miss you already. can you believe this happened?"," no... no! and yet it did. good-bye, janice."
445," hi, monica."," ok, well, this was very special."
446," oh my god. janice, hi!", janice is gonna go away now.
447, (in disbelief) whoa.," oh, good, joey's home now."
448," hey, rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...", how can i dump this woman on valentine's day?
449, i don't know. you dumped her on new year's.," oh, man. in my next life, i'm coming back as a toilet brush."
450," hello, funny valentine."," hi, just janice."
451, i brought you something.," is it loaded? oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) chan and jan forever."
452, i had them made special.," ok, janice. janice. hey, janice. look, there's no way for me to tell you this. at least there's no new way for me to tell you this. i just don't things are gonna work out."
453, that's fine., (surprised) it is?
454, mmm-hmm. because i know that this isn't the end.," oh no, you see, actually it is."
455," no, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. don't you know it yet? you love me, chandler bing."," oh, no i don't."
456, well then ask yourself this. why do you think we keep ending up together? new year's? who invited who? valentine's? who asked who into whose bed?," i did, but..."
457," you seek me out. something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. janice, janice. you want me. you need me. you can't live without me. and you know it. you just don't know you know it. see ya.", call me!
458, chandler., i'm doing this because i'm sorry?
459," yes. well, mr. kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day."," oh, listen. if this is about those prank memos, i had nothing to do with them. really. nothing at all. really. (chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) nothing."
460, what is it?," so, it's a typical day at work. i'm inputting my numbers, and big al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
461, that's great!, so.... i quit.
462, why?," okay, it's um…"
463," yeah, chandler... you've been there for five years."," if i took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what i actually do."
464, so was it a lot more money?, it doesn't matter. i just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the wenus.
465, ... the wenus?, weekly estimated net usage systems. a processing term.
466, so what're you going to do?, i don't know. that's the thing. i don't know what i want to do. i just know i'm not going to figure it out working there.
467," hi! (turns back to chandler, then to monica) oh, yeah, no, i know. you're a chef. i know, and i thought of you first, but um, chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....", yeah... i just don't have that much cheffing experience. unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
468," yeah, i know! (turns to chandler) so, what do you think?"," thanks, phoebe. but i just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
469, ok. (pause) oh monica! guess what!, can you see my nipples through this shirt?
470," where are you going, mr. suity-man?"," well, i have an appointment to see dr. robert pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) i added the ""a-gogo."""

472, i don't!," hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. you know, you have goals. you have dreams. i don't have a dream."
473,"so great! he showed me where the restaurant's going to be. it's this, it's this cute little place on 10th street. not too big, not too small. just right.", was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
474," ok, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?", who are you going out with?
475," oh, i just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and i'd introduce her to my monkey.", and he's not speaking metaphorically.
476, my god! what happened to you?," eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do i learn? (he taps the results and reads them) ""you are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""
477, that's so great! 'cause you already know how to do that!," can you believe it? i mean, don't i seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? you know, i just always pictured myself doing something...something."
478," (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up."," ooh, you know, i had a grape about five hours ago, so i'd better split this with you."

520, i can’t believe you. you still haven’t told that girl she doesn’t have a job yet?," well, you still haven’t taken down the christmas lights."
521," congratulations, i think you’ve found the world’s thinnest argument."," i’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?"
522, hey.," you know, once you’re inside, you don’t have to knock any more."
523, yep. ice capades.," wow, this is serious. i’ve never known you to pay money for any kind of capade."
524, okay., have fun at church-camp!
525," (shutting the door, then pointing vaguely at nina’s shapely departure) she’s still here."," yes, yes she is. didn’t i memo you on this? see, after i let her go, err, i got a call from her psychiatrist, dr. flanen-nen, dr. flanen, dr. flan.  and err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy."
526, you’re kidding? she seems so...," oh, no, no. nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! in fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all."
527, that’s unbelievable.," and yet, believable. so i decided not to fire her again until i can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others."
528, i see. i guess you never really know what’s goin’ on inside a person’s head.," well, i guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir."
529," aw, how can you say that? i can’t even get marcel to stop eating the bath mat. how am i gonna raise a kid?"," you know, ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different."
530, do you have a sec?," ah, sure, nina. what’s up?"
531," i don’t know. for the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks."," oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, of us."
532, maybe. but that doesn’t explain why they keep taking my scissors.," ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise."
533, i am?," sure, why not?"
534, oh my god! (rushing over to give him a big hug) you’re amazing!," oh, you don’t know. (presses a button.) helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on miss bookbinder’s raise?"
535, what?," well, it's just interesting. you know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.  one of life's great, unanswerable questions. i mean, who knows? maybe there's something even more painful than those things? like this."
536," oh, how’d she take it?"," pretty well. except for the stapler thing. (he holds up a bandaged hand.) little tip: if you’re ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... (he mimes nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk."
537," i mean, i know joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...", you’re not gonna lose him.
538," right, but, it is just me and the baby, so i'm thinkin' they can take us. and so i uh, hah-hah, i just heave it down field.", what are you crazy? that's a baby!
539," anyway, suddenly i'm down field, and i realise that i'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? only i know there is no way i'm gonna get there in time, so i am running, and running, and that, that is when i woke up. see i, i am so not ready to be a father."," hey, you're gonna be fine. you're one of the most caring, most responsible men in north america. you're gonna make a great dad."
540," yeah, ross. you and the baby just need better blocking.  oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the rainbow room? is it real expensive?"," well, only if you order stuff."
541, you take your time., there it is! so what're you gonna do?
542," what can i do? look, i don't want to do anything to screw it up with ursula.", and your friend phoebe?
543," well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. i mean, wouldn't you guys?"," man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit."
544," what? monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!"," alright, what have we learned so far?"

547," (as monica) yeah, i know... (mirroring her friend) ..i'm i'm just not that bright either."," okay, worst case scenario. say you never feel like a father."
548, uh-huh.," say your son never feels connected to you, as one. say all of his relationships are affected by this."
549, do you have a point?," you know, you think i would.  what's up with the simian?"
550, it's just a fur ball., okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
551,"yours, i just got 43 points for 'kidney'."," no, no, you got zero points for 'idney'."

553, yeah. the doctor got the 'k' out. he also found an 'm' and an 'o'., we think he was trying to spell out 'monkey.'
554," well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now."," (tapping ross on his shoulder) so, you feel like a dad yet?"
555," no, why?"," hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. that is very dad."

557, do you really want a job with popular mechanics?," well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for."
558, (grabs the bill) give me that!," you know, i can't believe you. linda is so great! why won't you go out with her again?"
559, i don't know., is this still about her whole 'the flintstones could've really happened' thing?
560," no, it's not just that. it's just—i want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins to stare lovingly at rachel)", ...little playthings with yarn?  could you want her more?

590," i agree. i'm, like, in disbelief."," i mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with rachel, they would've happened already?"
591," well, i think it's perfect. y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...", i can't remember the last time i got a girl to take care of my monkey.
592," anyway, i figured after work i'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.","hey, y'know what you should do? you should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used."
593," whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?", rachel lost marcel.
594, alright alright. you're a monkey. you're loose in the city. where do you go?," okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. i'll go to cats, you go to the russian tea room."

600," we can't, alright? (to the women) we're sorry. you have no idea how sorry, but... we promised we'd find this monkey. if you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out."," okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.  marcel?!"
601, that's because i'm in front of them., eh. i thought that was an alp.
602," i dunno, i loved high school. y'know? it was just four years of parties and dating and sex."," yeah, well i went to boarding school with four hundred boys. any sex i had would've involved a major lifestyle choice."
603, oh. oooh! ooh! ooh! (she stands up and starts to dance around) ooh! my butt cheek is waking up! oooh! ooh!, i can't believe you would actually say that. i would much rather be mr.peanut than mr.salty.

605," how can people do that?... (all but phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) oh, you guys, look! ugly naked guy got gravity boots!"," i am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. it was unbelievable! we could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
606, so have you called her yet?," let her know i like her? what are you, insane? (the girls make disgusted noises.) it's the next day! how needy do i want to seem? (to the guys) i'm right, right?"
607," oh, god, just do it! (grabbing the phone.) call her! stop being so testosteroney!"," which, by the way, is the real san francisco treat. (calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) i got her machine."
608, her answer machine?," no, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
609," so, uh, why didn't you say anything?"," oh, no-no-no-no. last time i left a spontaneous message i ended up using the phrase ""yes indeedy-o."""
610, that man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (rachel enters.) oh!," (bluffing) and basically, that's how a bill becomes a law."
611, oh!... right!, hey rach!

613," ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here..."," (on phone, reading from a script) oh, danielle! i wasn't expecting the machine... give me a call when you get a chance. (rattles some dishes) bye-bye. (hangs up.) oh god!"

617," i'm twelve, i'm not stupid.", can i use your phone?
618," yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone."," yes, it's working! why isn't she calling me back?"
619," y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.", y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
620," ...desperate, needy, pathetic?"," ah, you obviously saw my personal ad."
621, how many beeps?, she answered.
622," y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about."," i'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. now i'm needy and snubbed. god, i miss just being needy."
623," please. if she said to you, ""ross, i want you on this couch, right here, right now,"" what would you say?"," if it helps, i could slide over."
624," (leaving) i just have to go, all right? do i need a reason? huh? i mean i have things to do with my life, i have a jam packed schedule, and i am late- for keeping up with it. okay?", hello? hello?
625," (on phone) hello?(listens) mindy! hi! hey, how are you? (listens) yes, yes, i've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (listens) really? (listens) oh.

627, get down?, ...and boogie!
628," oh, hold up, i'll walk out with you. now, rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) that's fine, yeah..."," okay, i'm gonna go to the bathroom. will you watch my phone?"
629, why don't you just take it with you?," hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
630, why don't you just call her?," i can't call her, i left a message! i have some pride."
631, do you?," no! (calls) danielle, hi! it's, uh, it's chandler! (listens) i'm fine. uh, listen, i don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that i am, i accidentally shut off my phone. (listens) oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. (listens) okay. (puts down the phone.) (to monica) she's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.

637, (entering) chandler?," danielle! hi! uh- everybody, this is danielle, danielle, everybody."
638, hi. hi., what are you doing here?
639," well, i've been calling you, but it turns out i had your number wrong. and when i finally got the right one from information, there was no answer. so i thought i'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay."," ...i'm, i'm okay."
640," listen uh, maybe we could get together later?"," that sounds good. i'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
641, second date!, ...i dunno.
642, you don't know?!," well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if i was okay? i mean,... how needy is that?"
643," i think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.","wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop."
644," what? it's, it's just a phase."," well, that's what we said about joey..."
645," this is so unfair! she's got everything i want, and she doesn't have my mother.", how about joey... pepponi?
646," no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that's more neutral.", joey... switzerland?
647," plus, y'know, i think it should be joe. y'know, joey makes me sound like i'm, i dunno, this big. (waitress looks at him funny) which i'm not.", joe...joe...joe...stalin?
648, stalin...stalin...do i know that name? it sounds familiar.," well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
649," (writes it down) joe stalin. y'know, that's pretty good.", might wanna try joseph.
650, joseph stalin. i think you'd remember that!," oh yes! bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin. joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof."
651, at the vet.," she's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
652," she says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.", so what does this mean?
653," i can't believe it, ross. this sucks!"," i don't get it, i mean, you just got him. how can he be an adult already?"
654, how do you get a monkey into a zoo?," i know that one! ...no, that's popes into a volkswagen."
655," well, we're applying to a lot of them. naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, san diego... right? but that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at miami, so that's a possibility."," yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, it's a total party zoo."
656, nope. we took her to lunch., ah. your own brand of vigilante justice.
657," yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.", ...take off their hats!
658, (entering) you know there already is a joseph stalin?, you're kidding.
659, apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. you'd think you would've known that!," y'know, you'd think i would've."
660," we, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...", ...he's in.
661, oh!," okay, bye, champ. now, i know there's gonna be a lot of babes in san diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn."
662," look at you, you won't even look at him."," (sarcastically) oh, come on tell me. i could use another reason why women won't look at me."
663, doing it on this table. (points at the table), wow!
664," why, why, why would you dream that?"," more importantly, was i any good?"
665," well, you were pretty damn good."," interesting, cause in my dreams, i'm allways surprisingly inadequate. (monica pats him on his lap)"
666," i love it, when we share.", you're okay there?
667, i can't belive you two had sex in her dream.," i'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. i was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.  hello rachel."
668," just for some short-term-work. you know, until i get back some of my massage clients.", pirates again?
669," hey, hey, chan. she could work for you."," (sarcasticly) thanks joey, that's a good idea."
670," what... i could, i could do it. what is it?"," well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. she is having one of her boobs redused. (ross looks at her.) it's a whole big boob story."
671, i could be a secretary.," well, you know phoebs. i don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. for a large portion of the day."
672,"no, it's for when carol goes into labor. she can get me wherever i am. i mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-jimbo."," a cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid."
673, he's... our age., when we were?
674, college?, whoa! and this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
675, there you go., can you hear that?
676, (plays with a thumbtack remover) yeah?, see that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
677," oh. uh, i'm on. (picks up the phone)  (with a deep voice) mr. bing's office. (listens) no i'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.", i'm not in a meeting. i'm right... whoops.
678," will he know what this is in reference to? (listens) and he has your number? (listens) all right, i'll see that he gets the message. bye bye.  ross says hi.", ah!
679," this is so fun. all right, what do we do now?"," well, now, i actually have to get to work."
680," most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) okay, i'm gonna be out there.  all right. bye bye.", bye bye.  (answering it) yes?
681, whatcha doin'?, ooh. (leans against the desk)
682," oh, exellent. everyone was so, so nice."," see, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (joey and ross wonder what he means) me."

684," oh, because, you know... they don't like you.  i thought you knew that.", noho. who doesn't they like me?
685, everyone. except for uh... no everyone., what are you talking about?
686," don't feel bad. you know they used to like you a lot. but then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like ""mr. boss man"". you know, mr. bing. mr. bing, ""boss man bing"".", i can't belive it.
687," yeah, yeah. they even do you.", they do me?
688, you know like... uh okay... uh... 'could that report be any later?', i don't sound like that.
689, 'my scones.'," okay, i don't sound like that. that is so not true.  that is so not... that is so not... that... oh, shut up!"
690,"(on phone) okay, andr� should be there in like 45 minutes. all rightie, bye bye. (to phoebe) just easier that way."," oh, come on. you told me about the last dream."
691," no, forget it."," oh, why not. was i doing anything particularly... saucy?"
692," no. you know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.", and this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
693, stegosaurus!, tyrannosaurus!
694," um, oh, i've got a birthday party, with some work people.", work people? nobody told me.

773, how is that the silver lining?, you have to really wanna see it.
774, (on phone) hello? hi., (entering) hi. anybody know a good tailor?

793," no, no, carol. there's nothing wrong with it. i just, i just don't think breast milk is for adults.", of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.

797," i know, but, i was the best, you know? i liked being the best. (he downs the glass of juice in one swig.) i don't know. maybe i should just get outta the game. they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."," (pours more and slides the refill to joey) all right, say you do that. you know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. and then where're you gonna run?"

1406," look, what do you want me to say?", i want you to say that you like her!
1407," i can't. it's like this chemical thing, you know. every time she starts laughing, i just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that i can have something to throw at her."," thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) oh, and by the way there is no count rushmore!"
1408, women tell each other everything. did you know that?," umm, yeah."
1409," no chandler, everything! like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth...."," girth? why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?"

1415," with the belly-button ring? oh, muhawa!"," i know, and then all of the sudden your mom pops into your head. and your like 'mom, get outta here!' you know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. so it's kinda like, you're, you know. you know...(ross just stares at him). you don't know!"
1416," your mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your mom, what is the matter with you?", you said...

1419," i'm sorry man, i tired, i really did."," well, you know, i appreciate you giving it a shot."
1420," but, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and i survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. it was bat day at shea stadium."," well, i guess that's something."
1421," no man, that's huge! now, i know i can stand to be around her, which means i get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.  oh, hey, chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into ross.", oh god!
1422," hey, if it makes you feel any better, i do it too.", really?
1423," all right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. (takes a glass from the fridge.)", taste it.
1424," (drinks from the glass and puts it back in the fridge) yep, it's fat. i drank fat!"," yeah, i know, i did that two minutes ago."

1427, how is this your seat?, 'cause i was sitting there.
1428, but then you left.," well, it's not like i went to spain. i went to the bathroom, you knew i was coming back."
1429," what's the big deal, sit somewhere else."," the big deal is i was sitting there last, so, that's my seat."
1430," you guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. so.."," all right, ross, i just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. (yells at joey) get up!!"
1431," uh, no. wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. nevermind."," well, joey, i wrote a little song today. it's called: get up."
1432, all right! you can have the chair., really!
1433," what if it's new? i mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. shouldn't i call him back?"," honey, you did call him back. 'cause, it's, it's really old."
1434," i.....got.....dressed. really, really quickly. okay, okay. (rachel starts to follow monica into her room, but ross stops her and sends her back to her room.) there we go, there we go."," you know what, okay, fine. don't get up, you just sit right there. i just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches in front of joey's face) op, not touching, can't get mad! not touching can't get mad! not touching can't get mad! (joey flings some dip onto phoebe's dress)"
1435," okay, thanks. yeah, i'll try that.", maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
1436, noo! (monica starts to go back into her room and stops) no!," all right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. (sits on joey's lap) i'm soooo, comfortable."
1437," me too. in fact, i think i might be a little too comfortable.", all right! (jumps up)
1438," okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. okay, chandler, i want you to go and change! okay. and then, when you come back, joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. okay. okay."," all right! fine! i'm going. but when i get back it's chair sitting, and i'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! (leaves)"
1439," well, who's voice was that?"," maybe it was his sister's. you know, maybe it was his daughter's."
1440," yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. all right, come on, i'll just pick something out for you."," all right, you will notice that i am fully dressed. i, in turn, have noticed that you are not. so in the words of a. a. milne, ""get out of my chair, dillhole!"""
1441," okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)", what are you doing?
1442," you said i had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.", the cushions are the essence of the chair!
1443, that's right! i'm taking the essence.," oh-ho, it'll be back. oh-ho, there's nobody in the room."
1444," no honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. i love you. i love you.", we used them as pillows when we went camping.  (shyly) the sheep.
1445," whoa, whoa, whoa. come on, come on, what. you took his underwear?", he took my essence!
1446, it's a rented tux. okay. i'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.," well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions."
1447," okay, you hide my clothes. i'm gonna do the exact opposite to you."," what are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?"
1448," hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)", he's got nothing!
1449," rachel, didn't have anything that i liked, so, but she had this christmas ribbon, and i thought, 'all right, fine i'll be political.'", what are you supporting?
1450," it was, it was her voice."," monica, i think you've gone over to the bad place."
1451," (on phone) uh, michelle. yeah, that was me, i-i dialed your number by mistake. (listens) oh, you're so sweet. yeah, we were a great couple. i know i really miss him. well, you know how it is, it's that...."," (to phoebe) you know what's weird. donald duck never wore pants. but whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. i mean, what is that about?"
1452," okay, fine. (runs to her room)"," they got a phone in there, right?"
1453, (yelling from the bedroom) get away from that! no! (she comes into the living room carrying the phone) she's just getting dressed., is it wrong that i was totally aroused by that?
1454," okay, buddy-boy. here it is. you hide my clothes, i'm wearing everything you own.", oh my god! that is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
1455, look at me! i'm chandler! could i be wearing any more clothes? maybe if i wasn't going commando..., oooo-ooh!
1456," okay, okay. enough, enough with the lunging. no! i'm sick of this. okay. i've had it up to here with you two! neither you can come to the party!"," jeez, what a baby."
1457," (to joey) how 'bout instead you, go get changed! (to chandler) you, give him back his underwear! i'm gonna go get a cab, and i want everyone down stairs in two minutes! monica!", stop it. stop it!
1458," (sits down) well, i have to tell you, i was quite impressed with your paper on pre-cretaceous fossils. yeah, it confirmed everything that i have written.", excuse me. hi.
1459, yes?," well, your kind of sitting in my seat."
1460," what do you mean, your seat?"," i mean, i was sitting there."
1461," but, you got up!"," but, i never left the room!"
1462," but, you left the chair area."," all right, that's it, give me your underwear."
1463, (from bedroom) whoaa!!," (going to the bedroom) see joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed."
1464, nooo. i had a story all worked out but then chandler sold me out.," well, i'm sorry joe. i didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket."
1465," whoa, jam! i love jam! (to chandler) hey, how come we never have jam at our place?", because the kids need new shoes.
1466," oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to chandler) hey.", do i look fat?
1467, noo.," okay, i accept that. when janice asked me and i said no, she took that to mean that i was calling her a cow."
1468," okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it."," okay, well. janice said 'hi, do i look fat today?' and i, i looked at her...."
1469, and it works both ways.," okay, so you both just know this stuff?"
1470,"okay, for instance. let's say, janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. which do you do?"," that's easy, baggage claim."
1471," (buzzes) wrong! now you're single. it's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. that way she knows you love her."," okay, this is good, this is good. all right listen, i have one. janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know i'm all for. but, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. so, uh, how do i tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something."
1472, good luck chandler., thank you rachel.
1473," (blows her a kiss) okay the sleeping thing. very tricky business, but there is something you can do."," well, i thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers."
1474," noo! no, not cuddlily, not me, just her. i'm like you, i need the room. okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and ross puts his hands on chandler's shoulder and thigh.) okay, you're in bed...", yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
1475, i'm gonna use the cushion., yeah.
1476," okay, you're in bed. she's over on your side, cuddling. now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back over to her side of the bed. and then you rollll a-way. hug for her! roll for you."," okay, the old hug and roll."
1477, yep.," okay, one question."
1478, shoot., you're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
1479," okay, first i'm not crazy. and second, say it don't spray it. anyway his name is malcom, and he wasn't following me, i mean he was, but 'cause he thought i was ursula, ick. and, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'cause of the restraining order."," umm, not feeling better 'bout malcom."
1480, aww. (tastes it) ohh!," hey, joe, i gotta ask. the girl from the xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)"
1481," i figured out i need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. so, i've got a new plan now. babies."," well, your gonna need much bigger jars."
1482,"it took me 28 years to find one man that i wanna spend my life with, if i have to wait another 28 years then, i'll be 56 before i can have a baby, and that's just stupid."," that, that's what's stupid."
1483, night-night bing-a-ling.,"night-night.....janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. that would be weird though. okay, hug and roll time. i'm huggin', i'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! freedom! (his one arm is still under her) except for this arm! i'm stuck. stuck arm! okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. quick like a cat, quick like a cat! and 1...2...3!' (pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)"
1484," oh, okay. (he kisses her)"," no, that's all right. i just had a jar of mustard."
1485,"(entering from her bedroom) okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! okay, he's 6'2"", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male geena davis.", you mean there's more than one of us.
1486," well, right after i did that sex study down at nyu. (to chandler) hey, remember that sweater i gave you for your birthday?", and that's how you bought it?
1487," what, he's not still following her. do you think he is still following her?"," pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order."
1488," (sees joey) hey. (walks into the living room) uh, chan, can i uh, can i talk to you for a second?", sure. what's up?
1489, (to chandler) are you intrigued?, you're flingin'-flangin' right i am!
1490,"(on tv, finishing installing the milk master 2000) wow, it is easy. (starts to poor the milk) now, i can have milk everyday."," well, it's official there are no good movies."
1491, maybe you can tell me. my agent would like to know why i didn't show up at the audition i didn't know i had today. the first good thing she gets me in weeks. how could you not give me the message?!," well, i'll tell ya i do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
1492," (on phone) 'annie! hi. listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. who did you speak to in my office? estelle, no, i don't know what i'm going to do with her. no. all right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'", is anybody else scared?
1493," (on phone) 'right, well look, um, if joey loses this audition, that is it for estelle. i don't care! annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to monica) i need a pen.

1495," hey, i only got one good arm, you know. you should be doing stuff for me. go get me a sweater."," just do it! okay, it's janice and if i get it i'm going to have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) oh, that's great i'm gonna have to see her tonight."
1496, what's the big deal? why don't you wanna see janice?," okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes."
1497," and that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?", noo.
1498," you didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you."," no, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. and this alarm started going off in my head: 'run for your life! get out of the building!'"
1499," what is it with you people! i mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?"," i know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of thought, temporarily) that's why i don't want to go tonight, i'm afraid i'm going to say something stupid."
1500," hey, you know about that?!"," look what do i do? i wanna get past this, i don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. i wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!"
1501, (to joey) where there is no fear of commitment., do we have any...(turns around and bumps monica's fake chest) do we have any thoughts here?
1502," oh, yeah. go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!"," yeah, joe, i assure you if i'm staring down the barrel of a gun, i'm pretty much peeing every which way."
1503," so, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?"," 'cause, i wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)"
1504," ohhh, are you a puppy! (opens it) contact paper! i never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper."," well, wait there's, there's more. see the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) see, the drawer actually goes in my dresser."
1505," oh, you didn't have to do this."," yes, i did. yes, i did. because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get."
1506," well, i gotta buy a vowel. because, oh my gawd! who, would've thought that someday, chandler bing would buy me a drawer."," well, not me. but that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. we should take a trip."
1507, we should?," yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. and, i wanna meet your parents. we should take a trip with your parents!"
1508," (laughs) i don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! are you okay?"," i am, i actually am. i mean this is amazing. my entire life i have feared this place, and now that i'm here it's like what was the big deal. i could probably say 'let's move in together.' and i'd be okay."
1509, you probably want us to move in together?, it doesn't scare me!
1510," yeah, well, it scares me! i mean i not even divorced yet, chandler. you know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. and, and i wasn't even that hungry. you know what, it's getting a little late, and i-i should just, um...(starts to leave)"," oh, no, no, no, don't go! i've scared ya'! i've said too much! i'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (janice leaves, chandler then calls janice to leave a message on her machine) hey, janice! it's me. um, yeah, i-i-i just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)"
1511," honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)"," so, i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down."
1512, that is never good., then i got all needy and clingy.
1513," okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. maybe it's not so bad. how did you leave it?", she said she'd call me.
1514, ohh! (both grab there stomachs in pain), oh god.
1515, welcome to our side of the tunnel., this ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
1516," yeah, you do."," so, you don't think i'm terminal?"
1517," well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control."," okay, okay. so, should i call her?"
1518," right. so, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. and then act aloof."," so i'm not, not gonna lose her?"
1519," oooh, honey, you're not a total loser."," i said, 'so i'm not gonna lose her?'"
1520," (to butcher) no, thank you. (chandler makes a sound and she notices him) chandler!"," (in a british accent) hello, janice."
1521, what are you doing here?," (in accent) oh, just a bit of shopping. how've you been?"
1522, are you being british?!, (normal voice) no. not anymore.
1523, why are you shopping here? you don't live in this neighborhood. were you here waiting for me?," yeah, huh. i'm just uh, you know i'm just picking up some things for a party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)"
1524, barley? what kind of party serves barley?," well, i'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
1525, where is this party?, here in chelsea.
1526, who's party is it?, a woman's
1527, what woman?!, (shyly) chelsea.
1528," okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that i could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. so like which of these two guys do you want to be? (another guy walks by)", can i be that guy?
1529," (in a really, really bad italian accent) that's-ah what i suspected-ah."," ....and then i just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store."
1530," my god! chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'."," i've actually ruined this haven't i? it's time for the good ice cream now, right?"
1531," you know what, everything's gonna be okay."," (answering phone) hello. hi, janice! can you hold on for a second? okay. (to monica and rachel) okay, what do i do?"
1532, if-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call., hello!
1533," yes, and grumpy."," what are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) hello, janice. hi, i'm so glad that you called, i know i've been acting a really weird lately. and, it's just because i'm crazy about you, and i just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. i'm sorry.

1542," so, chandler, who’s on your list?"," ah, kim basinger, cindy crawford, halle berry, yasmine bleeth, and ah, jessica rabbit."
1543," now, you do realize that she’s a cartoon, and way out of your league?"," i know, i know, i just always wondered if i could get her eyes to pop out of her head."
1544, hardy boy., peter parker.
1545," well i-i-i, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. first, i’ll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....", (coughing) what a geek!
1546," hey, how do you guys get anything done?"," we don’t, really."
1547," yeah, i was thinking that maybe we could go down to time square and pick up some ninja stars. and, oh, um, my friend larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker."," you know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city."
1548," i know.  oh, i’m sorry. did i get ‘ya?"," no, you didn’t get me!! it’s an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!"

1750, come on!! (motions for chandler to come with him)," why can’t we talk in here? with, with, witnesses."
1751," why don’t you ask chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her. she told me you said you could really fall for her. now is that true? or are you just gettin’ over janice by groping my sister.", it’s gotta be the first one.
1752," really? that’s great! you and my sister, sittin’ in a tree."," yep, i’m in a tree."
1753, dear mary-angela. hi. how’s it going. this is the hardest letter i’ve ever had to write. (to chandler) what the hell’s a matter with you? how do you think joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?," well, that’s the part where you tell him that i moved to france. when actually i’ll be in cuba."
1754," all right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. at least you know her name. you just go to the house and you ask for mary-angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.", what if mary-angela comes to the door and i ask for mary-angela?
1755, where in cuba?," (shocked) joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?"
1756, waiting for my grandma to finish my laundry. what about you?, i’m here to see mary-angela.
1757," you are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my grandma doesn’t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. she was like the sixth person to spit on mussolini's hanging body. yeah.", where’s mary-angela?
1758, (shyly) you grow up.," this teramisu is, is excellent. did you make it mary-angela?"
1759, no! i did!," well, it’s, it’s yummy. so mary-angela do you like it?"

1764, (whispering in his ear) just do it., will you excuse me i have to um..... (walks to the hall)  (startled) hey!
1765," finally, i thought we’d never be alone. can i just tell you something, i have not stopped thinking about you since the party. (kisses him)"," look, i may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) um, i just got out of a relationship and i’m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place."
1766," so! me neither! god, mary-angela was right you do have the softest lips."," ahhhh, you’re not mary-angela."
1767," no, i’m mary-theresa."," this is so bad. if-if you’re not mary-angela, then-then who is?"

1770, what’s goin’ on?, (pats him on the shoulder) you’re it! now run and hide!
1771," what?! how could you do that, how could you think she was mary-angela?"," i wasn’t sure which one mary-angela was. (all of joey’s sisters gasp) look, i’m sorry okay, i was really drunk, and you all look really similar."
1772, yeah! punch him!!," y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me. (to joey) are ya?"
1773," well, that is usually what i would do. but i just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. how could you do this?!"," joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, i deserve it. but i just want you to know that i would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. i would never do anything like this ever again."
1774," no you won’t. look he knows he did a terrible thing and i believe him, he’s sorry. but, (to chandler) you’ve got one more apology to make, all right, you’ve got to apologize to mary-angela."," okay, absolutely!  you’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but he still doesn’t know which one is mary-angela.)"
1775," cookie, now you can punch him!", what?! (cookie punches him)
1776, thanks you guys! thank you., don’t worry.
1777," (running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) okay. hey. umm. does everybody hate these shoes?"," oh yeah, but don't worry. i don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress."
1778, (to chandler) it's her first day at this new job. your not supposed to start with her!," all right, i suppose i can wait a day. hey, what are you doing friday?  i need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin albert, y'know he's the botanist."
1779," oh god. y'know, botanists are such geeks.", yeah. is that a dinosaur tie?
1780,"(entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) morning. rach, i'm here with the purses!", (to phoebe) it must take you forever to find your keys.
1781," umm, no, it's a purse. and there's a thermos in it."," (to ross) hey, so can you make it on friday?"
1782," what? oh yeah, yeah i think so. why am i invited to this again?", well apparently albert has no friends. he's very excited about the bachelor party though. i think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
1783," a stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich�. why don't you get a magician?!"," well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right."
1784," she's having lunch with him. she's having lunch with him. and you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. and, and, and, (to joey) he's really good looking. (joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) what am i gonna do?", don't do anything. keep it inside. learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) don't cry outloud.
1785, (hanging up the phone) yes! guess who's in an audition for a broadway musical?," i want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer."
1786," ah joey, i don't think you get to pick the cities.  mr. dickens gets to pick 'em.", i'll get you the cliff notes.
1787, the what?, the abridgment.
1788," joey, all the roles got to dance a little. but believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.", ....three years of modern dance with twila tharp! five years with the american ballet theater?!
1789," yeah, i can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly)"," oh no, no, no, no."
1790," sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing."," all right, i have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) hello? (listens) (happily) hi! yeah listen, i'm, i'm in need of a stripper and i was told that you do that. (listens) let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) so would i, would i have to provide the grapes?"
1791, get out! i couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.," okay, we have our stripper. a miss crystal chandelier."
1792, (reading) the empty vase. translucent beauty...," to yourself. (finishing) hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good."
1793," all right, just give it back to me when your done. see you guys.", bye-bye.
1794," oh my god, oh my god! poor monica!"," what, what, what?!"
1795," what?! he was with her when he wrote this poem. look, (reading) 'my vessel so empty with nothing inside. now that i've touched you, you seem emptier still.' he thinks monica is empty, she is the empty vase!", you really think that is what he meant?
1796, why?! how?! how is he a genius?," look, don't you see what's happening here. instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you."
1797, what am i going to do?," well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. all right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits."
1798, i don't know you guys.," all right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. and he's being mr. joe sensitive, and she starts thinking 'maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'"
1799," and before you know it, she's with him. and you'll be all, 'ohh, man!' and he'll be all, 'yes!' and us, we'll be like, 'wh-whoa, dude.' and pretty soon you'll be like, (sadly) 'hhiii,' and, and, and, 'i can't go, rachel and mark might be there.' and we'll be like, 'man get over it, it's been four years!!'", he paints quite a picture doesn't he?
1800," so ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?"," oh yeah, yeah! look what i got, look what i got. (holds up a pen) see, she's fully dressed, right?  and then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. and then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. she's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (rachel just stares at him.)"
1801, (entering) hi.," y'know what, i'm, i'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen."
1802, i gotta get going. bye chandler.," oh, okay ross. listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?"
1803, there was a woman at the... (realizes) the stripper?!  you have a play date with a stripper?!," man, i gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)"
1804," ugh. wait, wait, wait.  (to chandler) well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know."," yeah. either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper."
1805," no it’s not too soon, i had lunch at a eleven."," yeah, baby!  making chocolate milk. do you want some?"
1806," monica, what are you doing?"," well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him."
1807," um, chandler, ross, this is robert."," oh, hey."
1808," (to robert) you’ve have lipstick right here (points to her cheek). that’s okay, it’s mine, we just kissed."," (to robert) so ah, isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?"
1809," well, i’m from california."," right, right. sometimes you guys just burst into flames.  (standing up) i’m up! i’m up, i’ve gotten up now! anybody ah, want anything?"
1810," yeah, make that three."," okay ross, why don’t you come with me?"
1811," okay. (goes over to the counter) (to chandler) what ah, what is the matter with you? what’s going on?", robert’s coming out.
1812," what, what do you mean, what? is he gay?", no. he.....he’s coming out of his shorts.
1813," no, no, that won’t be ah, that won’t be necessary (leans down and looks up robert’s shorts, seeing robert’s package.)", (to ross) wellll?
1814," yeah, yeah, yeah!", what do we do? what do we do?
1815," well, i suppose we just try to not look directly at it.", like an eclipse.
1816, these little women. wow!," your liking it, huh?"
1817, but jo’s got a crush on laurie. (ross nods his head) oh. you mean it’s like a girl-girl thing? ‘cause that is the one thing missing from the shining.," no, actually laurie’s a boy."
1818," oh, okay, i learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.", you mean a three pointer?
1819, you guys!! come on!," i’m sorry, i’m sorry, it just seems that robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped."
1820, oh! wow! hey!," stretchy pants! why, those are the greatest things in the world! if i were you i would wear them every day, every day!"
1821, all right i’ll talk in code. (to ross and chandler) remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?," hmmm, that’s very cool."
1822, joey! i can’t believe you just did that!, i can’t believe she cracked your code!
1823, is that true? if i keep reading is beth gonna die?," no, beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. does she rachel?"
1824," listen, robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?  please, right now, no, every time i see him it’s like ‘is it on the lose?’ ‘is it watching me?’"," we can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff."
1825," (to chandler) hey, don’t we have to..."," yeah, we got, um-hmm."
1826," oh-ho yeah! a song with rhyming words. oo, i never thought of that before.", i like her.
1827, (to chandler) why? because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?," well, that’s pretty much all i’m looking for from these people."
1828," i ran into vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm...."," (to ross) all right listen, i have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. i’d like know whether that’s several big fish or just one big fish."
1829, (to chandler) someone in there?," no. this is just part of a dare devil game that i play called ‘wait until the last moment before i burst and die.’  jeez, man did you fall..(sees it’s a beautiful woman coming out of the men’s room) hi! so ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?"
1830," someone was in the lady's room, i couldn’t wait. i left the lid up for ya though."," (to gunther) y'know what gunther, go ah, go ahead, i’m-i’m talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) this is the part where you say your name."
1831, ginger.," ginger. i’m talking to ginger, so...."
1832, don’t you have to use the bathroom?," nope, nope, i’d just ah, i’d rather talk to you. (pause) yes, i do. yes, i do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)"
1833, i ran!!," well, that’s the best kiss i’ve had with anyone i’ve ever met in a men’s room."
1834," actually, me too."," (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle."
1835," oh damn, i hate that."," yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes."
1836," oh, don’t worry about it."," no, really you’re gonna freeze."
1837," no, i’m not."," you’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?"
1838," oh, can i borrow this? (points to his milk) my milk’s gone bad."," oh, i hate that. i once had a thing of half and half, stole my car."
1839," so umm, how was your date with ginger?"," great. it was great. she’s ah, she’s great, great looking, great personality, she’s greatness."
1840," sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package."," joey told you about the leg, huh?  oh god, it freaked me out. okay, i know it shouldn’t have, but it did. i mean i like her, i don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s like ‘hey, y'know what, where’s your leg?’ i mean i’m the smallest person in the world aren’t i? i’m the smallest person in the world."
1841, (entering from his bedroom) morning., (to monica) actually he’s the smallest person in the world.
1842, (to chandler) heard about the leg burnin’ huh?, it came up.
1843, your thinking about my leg aren’t you?," no. no. actually i forgot, what is the deal with that again?"
1844, it’s okay if it bothers you. really. i mean the only thing i need to know is: ‘how much it bothers you?’ because i don’t like wasting my time. am i wasting my time?, no. no. i don’t think so.
1845," okay. it’s just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.  what’s that?", that’s-that’s my nubbin.

1850, where have you been?, the doctor.
1851, is everything okay?," oh yes! just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. yep! two nipples, no waiting."
1852," come on! come on, i was kidding! it was such an obvious joke!"," that was an obvious joke, and i didn’t think of it. why didn’t i think of it? the source of all my powers. oh dear god, what have i done!"

1863," yeah. hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?", yes. vividly.
1864, she was kidding about that right?," yeah, i-i-i think so. (pauses and thinks about it for a second) yeah, i-i think so..."
1865," god, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?"," yeah. yeah, i mean what, what would we do?"
1866," dude, i don’t know."," she was kidding.  she was.... but y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules."
1867," yeah, for sure. okay. probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don’t want to be seeing."," yeah. good call, nice one. hold it!! hold it! what if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)"
1868," ah!! okay! eyes open at all times! oh, hey, how do we decide where we... (clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?"," right. right. well ah, y'know we could flip for it."
1869," yeah, i guess, but what’s like heads and what’s tails?"," well it you don’t know that, then i don’t want to do this with you."
1870,"i want you to met some friends of mine. (introduces him to chandler and joey) this guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don’t do that, and he says you gotta. and y'know what, we did it. and now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say ‘let’s ross it!’", and that’s the only colour that comes in.
1871, oh! (storms off)," so, what are you doing here? i thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner."
1872," what can i do? one person wants to break-up, you break-up."," hey, no way! come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
1873," oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t i have to wait a while?"," hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!  y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth."

1875, they have the best stuff in there., oh my god! oh my god!
1876," you think?! god, i, ah, i’m in hell. i mean what, what am i gonna do? rachel’s all like, ‘i love you and, and let’s work on this.’ and all i can think about is, ‘what is she gonna do? what is she gonna say?’ when i tell her what i did."," well, before we answer that, i think we should address the more important question. how dumb are you?"
1877," look, ross look, i’m on board about this totally honesty thing, i am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble."," he’s right. nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her."
1878," yeah, but don’t you think...."," all right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. and that’s what deathbeds are for."
1879," oh, i-i don’t think there’s any trail."," okay, okay-okay, ah, chloe works with that guy issac. issac’s sister is jasmine. and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe. and phoebe’s friends with rachel. and that’s the trail, i did it!"
1880," it’s okay, it’s okay.  we were just waxing our legs.", off?!!
1881," for your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience."," yeah, well i don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely."
1882," oh yeah, come here. (puts a little wax on joey’s arm and puts a strip on it.)"," oh, that’s mature."
1883, i can’t talk to you. i can’t even look at you right now!," nothing, nothing."
1884," oh, i knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday."," yeah, well, i guess they had a fight, and he got drunk...."
1885, oh!! (hits chandler and joey in the head) you guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!," (to joey) he has sex, and we get hit in our heads."

1888," oh, that is so sweet. i think i’m falling in love with you all over again."," y'know what, i think we can go out there. i mean they have more important things to worry about."
1889," look rachel, i wanted to tell you, i thought i should, i-i did, and then chandler and joey convinced me not to."," (handing monica the wax) wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever."
1890, we could eat the wax! it’s organic.," oh great, food with hair on it."
1891," no, not the used wax.", because that would be crazy?
1892," they’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?"," yeah, come on, it’s ross and rachel, they’ve got too."
1893," you think i need a new walk?  well y'know, i’ve been walking the same way since high school. y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. i think i need a ‘take notice’ walk.", are you actually saying these words?
1894, maybe she killed him?, let’s go.  (to joey) is that your new walk?
1895," (whispering) no, i really have to pee.  can i see the comics?", this is the new york times.
1896, guys. i thought you were taking ross to the game?, we are. he’s meeting us here.
1897," well ross was hangin’ out over at our place, rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from chandler...."," yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? rachel came over to borrow something."
1898,"whoa!! he is soo unreasonable! god, although i think i understand what he means. oh my god, this is like 60 minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow."," y'know what this is like? this is like when my parents got divorced. man, i hope ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after cub scouts."
1899," oh, i had the opposite dream."," y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, i mean it’s been a week."
1900, (softly) is he here?, no.

1903, chandler!!," look, i’m sorry. okay? i’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry."
1904, you’re smoking again?!," well, actually, yesterday i was smoking again. today, i’m, i’m smoking still."
1905, why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?," look, i’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when i started smoking in the first place."
1906, weren’t you nine?!," yeahhh. i’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....  oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him."
1907," him? him, ross?","nope, hymn 253, his eyes are on the sparrow! when my parents got divorced is when i started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it’s rachel again.)"
1908, chandler! you’re smoking? what are you doing?!," hey, shut up!! you’re not my real mom!!"
1909," look, you guys i just wanna say, i really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. it’s been a pretty hard time right now, so i just wanna say thanks.", can somebody else hug him? i have to stay by the window.
1910," pity food? y'know what that’s okay, all right, i don’t need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays."," well, then, i might as well offer to stay."
1911, why? do you think he’s still mad at us?, (to joey) well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
1912, chandler!!  what does the sign say?, beam me up jesus.
1913," no, the ‘no smoking’ sign. there’s no smoking in my grandmother’s cab."," okay, well, then, i-i have to go to the bathroom."
1914, no chandler no! no unscheduled stops. you can go when we stop for gas.," oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! come on, i really have to goooooooooo."

1916," no, y'know what don’t close it (rachel slams the door shut locking themselves out.) ‘cause the... keys...are in there."," oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!"
1917, what’s going on?," oh joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!"
1918," relax okay, i-i-i can get this open. anybody have a coat hanger?"," oh i do! op, no, wait a minute, i took it out of my shirt when i put it on this morning."
1919," no, i stuff outside the bra."," ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? phoebe, rachel take off monica’s bra."
1920," (seeing him) chandler, what are you doing? there is a trash can right there."," well, i thought if i littered, that crying indian might come by and save us."
1921," thank you phoebe, that is very, very generous."," okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass."
1922," oh, yeahhhhh!!!", at least let me smoke it to the good part.
1923," oh yeah, smokey joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.", i have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)
1924, then why are you smoking?, well it’s very unsettling.
1925, arrrghh!!," oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!"
1926," (to chandler and monica) you guys, what, what do we do about ross who drove all the way up here? what do we do? just like send him back and we’re then gonna go skiing?"," oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible."
1927, excuse me?," okay, ms. mckenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to tulsa and be the president of our office there, and i was sleeping and apparently, said yes."
1928," i-i can’t handle this, you guys."," y'know what, i can handle it, handle’s my middle name. actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name."
1929," obviously not to joey.  (to rachel) look both, joey and monica feel the same way that i do. no-no-no-no."," guys, guys, guess who i am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)"
1930, that would be great., i was being shelly winters from the poseidon adventure.
1931," (to chandler) oh, no-no, no-no-no, there’s none of that in here.", oh come on man! at least let me finish this last one.
1932," okay, but only if you give me a drag.  oh dark mother, once again i suckle at your smokey tit. (hands chandler back the cigarette.)"," no-no, why don’t you hang on to that one.  okay, that’s like the least fun game ever."
1933," well, i’m really sick of your smoking, so i brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)"," oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) nope, that patch is no good. (joey and monica both do their fake laughs.)"
1934," all right, y'know forget hypnosis. the way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.", or what my father called thursday night.
1935," okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. (to joey) i’m gonna, i’m gonna get my ah, my fianc�e man!"," y'know, i would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married."

1937, ohhh. (they embrace in a very passionate kiss.)," if that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?"
1938," well, umm, walker was looking for this big bus load of kids…. (realises) all right, i get your point."," (entering, carrying a briefcase) hi.  y'know, i forgot the combination to this about a year ago? i just carry it around. do you have any chap stick?"
1939," hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?"," y'know what, pretty good.  good! i haven’t smoked yet today, i feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse."

1951, two., wow!! can joey and i put them on and fight?
1952," well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks."," it’s possible. you are very loveable, i’d miss you if i broke up with you. (ross glares at him) i was just trying to be supportive."
1953, then be supportive like a guy.," (in a deep voice) if i broke up with you, i’d miss you."
1954," so, you’re like a zillionaire? (pete smiles and nods)", and you’re our age. you’re our age.
1955," oh, oh, i got it! pete-chicago.", that’s not a state joe.
1956, it does in mine!," i can blow dry it. i can put gel on it. it doesn’t matter, i still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. it’s so annoying. does it bug you?"
1957, you bug me., is there any chance you didn’t see that?  ross! you gotta stop! okay?! you can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! you’re gonna get peep eye!
1958," i knew it! i knew it! i always knew she liked him! y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! right? we just broke up, first thing she does!", you didn’t just break up.
1959," hey, it’s been like three weeks!", you slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. i mean bullets have left guns slower!
1960," here they come, here they come. oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, i’m gonna kill myself, i swear. i can’t, i can’t watch this.

1966," juice, i need..."," she’s moving on! okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! and unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! okay, man? it’s over."
1967," yeah, okay.  it’s just i miss her so much.", i know. (he rubs ross’s head)
1968, (to monica) one second.," i don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (he blows on his hand) draw!!

1969," just because she went to yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!"," ah, sliced bread, a wonderful lady macbeth."
1970," god, i just, i hate her! i hate her!! with her, ‘oh, i’m so talented.’ and ‘oh, i’m so pretty,’ and ‘ooh, i smell so good.’", i think somebody has a crush on somebody.

1972," oh. (realises) ohh. ohh, you’re out of your mind.","hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! if you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!"
1973," (to chandler) hey! (chandler looks up, startled) why isn’t it spiderman? y’know like goldman, silverman...", ‘cause it’s-it’s not his last name.
1974, it isn’t?," no, it’s not like, like phil spiderman. he’s a spider, man. y'know like ah, like goldman is a last name, but there’s no gold man."
1975, (she takes the t-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) no. nothing. (she smiles and goes into her room.)," so, ahh, what kind of powers would gold man have?"
1976," okay well, he would turn things to gold.", what about things that are already gold?
1977," ahh, his work is done."," okay, let’s play my game now."

1979," any time you want. y'know, when i was younger, all i wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! it was to be looked at, but never played with.", my grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
1980," thanks for lunch, chandler. y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here."," oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem. (he starts to look around her office.)"
1981," honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?"," yes, i realise that."

1987," okay, my boss, joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you..."," oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? dug my action, did she? checkin’ out the chan-chan man!"
1988," (looks at him) that was (pause) surreal. okay, what do think? are you interested at all?"," yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. i’ll do it."
1989, ahhhh!!," (entering) hey, my father’s house does that!"
1990," (to chandler) o-o-o-okay, how did it go? tell me everything."," well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp new york evening.  of course, i didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because joanna’s such a big, dull dud!"
1991," yep. i just, i just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. and then i knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this. (he closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he’s been processed by the devil, or something.)"," (entering with rachel) i’m telling ya, joanna’s got it all wrong. okay? all i said was, ‘this was fun. let’s do it again sometime. i’ll give you a call.’"
1992," ohh, gee. i wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?", that’s what you say at the end of a date.
1993," you can’t just say, ‘nice to meet you, good night?’"," to her face? look it’s the end of the date, i’m standing there, i know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘i’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. i can’t help it, it’s a compulsion."
1994, (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) call her! call her now!," multiple, so many paper cuts."
1995," why hasn’t he called rachel? why? why? i don’t understand. why? he said he’ll call. why? why? chandler i’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!"," (sarcastic) oh, well give me the phone then."
1996," come on, this isn’t funny. she thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. you have to call her!"," look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘in case you didn’t notice, i don’t like you!’"
1997, well then you’re going to have to take her out again., nooo!! she’s really dull! and she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
1998," i don’t care! i don’t care! you are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. and, i don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!"," all right! fine! but it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! and from now on i get my own dates, i don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!"
1999, that’s fine!," that’s just a lot of big talk, y'know."
2000," (she pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) ohh, the-the foster puppets!"," it’s not a big deal. it’s, just it’s right here, (points to his eye) and it’s all the time."

(sees he still has the chick) ahh! what are you doing?! i thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.," i did! but the store wouldn’t take her back! so then i took her to the shelter, and you know what i found out?  if they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! and i’m not gonna let that happen to little yasmine!"
2031," okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause i was kinda having second thoughts too.", okay. and it’s not just chicks y'know? it’s all kinds of other animals!

2051," (drags chandler over to buffet table) i’m telling you, this guy rachel is with is crazy! okay? he viscously screamed at total strangers! i think he’s baaad news!"," wait a minute, wait a minute, you don’t like the guy rachel’s dating? well, that’s odd."
2052," ooh, what a shame! because with her face (points to monica) and her chest (points to rachel) i could really put something together.", could i borrow it?
2053, (bringing chandler a cup) this is from the woman at the bar., oh-ho-ho-ho.
2054, one., two.
2055," no, it’s not just ‘cause i’m jealous. (both monica and chandler give him a ‘come on’ look) i mean i’m not, i’m not, i’m not jealous, okay? it’s… look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats."," yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!"
2056, we’re kidding!," ross, don’t. ross!"
2057," ooh, i don’t know. probably the smell of freshly cut grass."," ohh, that’s a good one."

2060," sorry, i’m so sorry, i will pay you back."," and yet, she’s still not hanging up the phone."
2061," hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? we could call it chuck.", or... dick.
2062," listen, i-i need a favor. umm, i was in the shower, and as i was cleansing myself, i ah, i-i, well i felt something.", was it like a sneeze only better?

2067,"98 hot saves, highest in the force."," well, y'know if joey and i played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred."
2068," (dead serious) fire safety is not a joke, son."," you're right, i know."
2069, (going over to him) well?!," (joining them) okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?"
2070," he couldn't even tell me! he said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. and the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it."," y'know what? you should go to my guy, because when i went in there with my third nipple. he just lopped it right off. y'know? so i guess i'm lucky. i mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples."
2071," (starting to get up) i gotta go water pete's plants. (stops) y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe i won't water his plants."," well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe joey and i should water his plants. if y'know what i mean."
2072," yeah, but jason's really sensitive."," well sensitive is important, pick him."
2073," no-no-no, that's a video-phone. but hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.", (sitting down on the couch) i-kea! this is comfortable.
2074," okay. well, it's good news. it's good news."," so, what do you thing the good news is?"
2075," would you stop? we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, i mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose."," yes, but this is pete. okay? he’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to rome. for most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing."
2076, all right. i gotta go. i have break up with vince.," oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh?"
2077," uh yeah, i can’t believe i ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area. (walks out)"," (comforting the duck) everything’s gonna be all right. okay, dick?"
2078," hmm, let me see. let me see. do you think you could get him to eat a bat?"," do you think that there’s a town in missouri or some place called sample? and ah, as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign, and it says “you’re in sample.” (he says it like urine sample.)"
2079," and it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal."," yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “they’re are no rules.”"
2080," so thanks for the warm welcome. it’s good to have you guys on my team, and i come to play. i hope you do too. now, let’s go out there and get ‘em! huh? and remember, there is no ‘i’ in team."," yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office."

2083," (stunned) dude, what are you doing?"," thank you! today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal."
2084," yeesh, what’d you do about it?"," well, i didn’t do anything. i didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom."
2085," y'know i don’t, i don’t understand guys, i mean i-i would never congratulate monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob."," yeah, i know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between ‘em."
2086," yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. y'know? what you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?", (to ross and monica) what if joey were president?
2087," bing! (chandler stands bolt upright and turns around to face him.) read your computech proposal, a real homerun. (he goes to slap his butt, but chandler slides over making him miss.) ooh. barely got ya that time, get over here. come on. (chandler goes over) wham! (slaps him on the butt) good one. that was a good one. (to a couple of chandler’s co-workers) keep at it team. (goes into his office)", (to his co-workers) what is with him?
2088, we never get smacked.," well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once."

2090," okay, i hear you! are you capable of talking about any thing else?", (joining them) hey! which one’s my turkey burger?
2091," okay, we’ll be right in. (to chandler) so ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?"," nine times! okay, i had to put on lotion! but, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow i’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free."
2092, (sticking his head out the window) fight’s over!," excuse me, doug? (no reaction) hey there sports fan!!"
2093, (turning around) bing! you got those numbers for me?," no, i ah, i didn’t do them."
2094," oh, you forgot?"," no, no i just ah, didn’t do them. instead, i ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so i certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise."
2095," well, i got tanked myself last night. pretty dicey drive home, tapanzi bridge never looked smaller. (laughs) that’s okay, you’re still my number one guy! (slaps him on the butt) bing!", doug!!
2096, hmm., i’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
2097," oh, is it the swearing? i mean is it the constant swearing? because i gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!"," no, no. it-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock."
2098, oh?," oh, and don’t get me wrong, i appreciate the sentiment. it’s just that i, i have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous."
2099," well, say no more. y'know it takes guts to bring this up. bing! you’re okay.", okay. (he starts to leave)
2100," ha! (goes to smack him on the butt, but stops, faking chandler out) ahhhhhhh!"," ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)"

(smacks him on the butt) joel-burg, you maniac! i love ya! (smacks him on the butt) (chandler walks up) bing! good job, couldn’t have done it without ya. (he shakes his hand)"," thank you, sir."
2102," of course, you did. forgot something else too ya bastard! (smacks him on the butt) (to chandler) well, what about you? you’re not feeling left out or anything are ya?"," no. no, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous."

2108," (watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) would you look at them. am i ever gonna find a boyfriend again? i gonna die an old maid."," you’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook."
2109, (sarcastic) thanks!," hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, i’ll be your boyfriend."
2110, yeah right., why is that so funny?
2111, you made a joke right? so i laughed.," ha-ha-ha. a little to hard. what am i not ah, boyfriend material?"
2112," well, no. you’re chandler. y'know, chandler! (hits him on the arm)"," okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. but theoretically y'know, i mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. i show up at your door, and i’m like (in a fake voice) “hey, nice to meet, ya. hey, oh-hey.”"

2120," well i assume the ah, happy couple isn’t up yet. did you guys hear them last night?"," oh, yeah, i don’t know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house."
2121," yeah, well, don’t “aww pheebs, that sucks!” me yet. (she starts to leave)", where ya going?
2122," noo! maybe! i, i don’t know. ross, i still can’t forgive you for what you did, i can’t, i just, but sometimes when i’m with you i just, i feel so...  i just, i feel, i-i just...  i feel..."," (to joey) noo!! i don’t care! i’m not, i’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!"
2123," that’s not true! her, she doesn’t even know what she wants! rachel’s still mad about the whole thing."," okay, then you gotta back away, all right? you don’t need that kind’ve hurt. take it from a guy who’s never had a long term relationship......"

2130, (closing the fridge in disgust) shoot! we’re out of soda.," (jumping up) oh, i’ll go out and get you some.  nope! because i’m not your boyfriend. (to phoebe, who’s entering) hey pheebs, how did it go?"
2131," well, umm, my mom’s friend, phoebe, is actually my birth mom.", i found a dried up seashores.
2132, i know. (hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from the letter.)," all right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, i’m the last man on earth. would you go out with me?"
2133, ennnh., i’ve got canned goods.
2134," (jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) hey, you guys! take a look at this! (chandler and monica jump up and go over to the hole.) check this baby out, dug me a hole!"," excellent hole, joe."
2135," jellyfish sting! oh, it hurts! it hurts!! it hurts!!"," well, can we help?! you want us to take you back to the house?!"

2137," don’t blame me, i saw it on the discovery channel."," y'know what, he’s right. there’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain."
2138," nothing, i don’t know.  nothing. i’m gonna take a shower.", me too!!
2139," it does. it really and truly does.  (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) it so does not!!!  she wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. i mean she goes on for five pages about, about how i was unfaithful to her! (both joey and chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”well...”) (yelling) we were on a break!!!!!"," oh my god! if you say that one more time, i’m gonna break up with you!"
2140, no?," look, ross, you have what you want, you’re back with rachel. if you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you."
2141," pass the cheese, please.  my god, you can’t even look at me! can you?", (jumping up) hey! phoebe! we can talk to phoebe!!
2142, no. i’m-i’m to depressed to talk., i’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
2143," (stopping him) no! joey, we swore we’d never tell!", (running over and joining monica) they’ll never understand!
2144, (interrupting) all right!! all right. (walks slowly into the living room) i got stung. stung bad. i couldn’t stand. i-i couldn’t walk., (following monica) we were two miles from the house. scared and alone. we didn’t think we could make it. (he goes to put his hands on monica’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
2145, and i was tired from digging the huge hole!, and then joey remembered something.
2146," that’s right i stepped up! she’s my friend and she needed help! and if i had too, i’d pee on anyone of you! only, uhh, i couldn’t. i got the stage fright. i wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. so-so i uh, i turned to chandler."," (wails loudly into his hands) joey kept screaming at me, “do it now! do it!! do it! do it now!!” sometimes late at night i can still here the screaming."
2147, (yelling from the bedroom) we were on a break!!!!!!!, (entering with joey) (to monica) coffee house?
2148," and hey! just so you know, it’s not that common! it doesn’t happen to every guy! and it is a big deal!!", i knew it!!!!
2149, (sets down some cards) gin.," we were playing gin? y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked."
2150, will you stop!, okay. all right.
2151," okay, all right, i think you’re great, i think you’re sweet, and you’re smart, and i love you. but you will always be the guy who peed on me.", wow! that ripped! that ripped real nice!
2152," how many times do i have to tell you! ya, turn and sliiiide! y'know, turn and slide."," you don’t turn and slide, you throw it out! i’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time i get dressed!"
2153," look, we’re not throwing it out! i built this thing with my own hands!"," all right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it."
2154," all right. but, you’re gonna have to tell them. (he opens the cabinet to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with christmas lights and a disco ball as decorations.)", (nods his head) do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to joey) they seem all right with it!
2155," (reading the newspaper) hey, here’s a question; where did you guys get the finest oak east of the mississippi?"," uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land."
2156," looks good, uh?"," (reading the ad) stunning entertainment center. fine, (pause) fine italian craftsmanship. (joey is very proud of himself)"
2157, why? i love that thing., you want it?

2162," (to chandler) dude, phoebe’s mom has got a huge peni...", (interrupting) let it go!!
2163," well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, i don’t think any of them are gonna work out."," yes, joey has a very careful screening process. apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails."
2164, pretty nice?," you’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
2165,"we don’t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? we’ve got a canoe."," y'know, i, i really don’t think we need a canoe."
2166, you gotta take the canoe!," all right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!"
2167," he is right, isn’t he?"," y'know what, i think this might be one of the times he’s wrong."
2168, you think?," please, please, please, don't be mad at me."
2169, all right!!, i’m coming already!!
2170," yeah, they still wear underwear.", oh my god!!!
2171, (still trapped in the entertainment center) what?!!, are you all right?!
2172, yeah..., wow! you look amazing!
2173," (getting out) awww, man! he promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!", what the hell happened?!! how were you locked in?!! and where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
2174," well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!", so—you got in voluntarily?!
2175," i was tryin’ to make a sale!! oh, man, if i ever run into that guy again, do you know what i’m gonna do?", bend over?!!!
2176, (entering) oh my god! what happened?,"oh, umm, joey was born, and then 28 years later, i was robbed!!"
2177," (entering) hey! so ah, what did the insurance company say?"," oh, they said uh, “you don’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.”"
2178," yeah, okay, listen, umm, mom, i hope you know you still mean a lot to me. and you’re welcome to come back anytime."," pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate it. (joey nods in agreement)"
2179," dude, you don’t have to brag! we got nothing here!!  hey!! we are so in luck! treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. wait right there. (goes back into the hall)"," oh no-no-no, i’m, i’m paddling away!"
2180, (returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) huh?!, wow! really?! we get all this rusty crap for free?!
2181," uh-huh. this and a bunch of bubble wrap. and, some of it is not even popped!", could we be more white trash?
2182, just pickle.," hey uh, rach, funny story. i ah, bumped into joanna on the street yesterday."
2183," my boss, joanna? wow, that must’ve been awkward."," well, no, actually she uh, asked me if i wanted to get a drink."
2184," (laughs) you ah, you didn’t say ‘yes’ to that did you?", (laughs) no. no!
2185," (coming out of the shower wearing nothing but a towel) hello, rachel. (she goes into chandler’s bedroom)"," well, not at first."
2186," what is she doing here?  i don’t understand! last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’"," well, i think i judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level."
2187," well, last time i almost got fired. you must end it, you must end it now!"," oh, come on! it’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! i mean usually i’m pretty much just in there by myself."
2188," chandler!! (he turns around quickly) promise me, you will end it."," okay, i promise, i’ll end it.  i hope you know what i’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what i mean."
2189, nooo!! (joey quickly stops nodding his head.)," …it was like the algonquin kids table. (they all laugh, but joey only laughs not to be left out.)"
2190," op, the ruined quiches are ready.", it just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.
2191," no, we are. i’m sad.  (answering the phone) yes. (listens) uh, can’t you wait until tomorrow? (listens) all right. (hangs up) unbelievable!!", thanks.
2192," no, no, that was my boss. i have to go.", okay. (starts to button up his shirt)
2193, wait. i wanna show you something., what is it?
2194, just a little gag gift somebody gave me. (she’s holding a pair of handcuffs) put your hands together.," ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me. (she kisses him) yeah, you are! (she handcuffs him to the chair) ooh, saucy."
2195, (kisses him) i’ll be back in ten minutes. (starts to leave)," you are, you’re gonna leave me like this?"
2196," knowing you’re here, waiting for me i think it’s kinda exciting."," okay. but if you don’t come back soon, (she leaves and closes the door) there’s pretty much nothing i can do about it!"
2197, yeah!, refill?
2198, (on speaker phone) i’m really sorry but i may be a little while longer., how little?!
2199," a couple of hours, i feel awful."," look, this isn’t funny! you get back here right now!"
2200, (answering it) (angrily) what?!," (in a serious, businesslike tone) rachel, could i see you for a moment?  okay, here’s the situation. the keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? and on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit."
2201, you promised you would break up with her!," i did break up with her! she just took it really, really well!"
2202, and the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!," it did enter my mind! but then something happened that made it, shoot right out."
2203," y'know what chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them."," no-no-no-no-no-no-no!! i can’t get myself right out of them! you must have me confused with the amazing chandler!! come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and i’m cold, and (stops and looks up the skirt on a statue behind joanna’s desk.)"
2204," oh, chandler!! all right, this is it! (grabs the key) you never see joanna again!", never!
2205, you never come into this office again!, fine!
2206, you give me back my walkman!, i—never borrowed your walkman.
2207," well, then i lost it. you buy me one!", you got it! here we go! come on! this is great! (rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) ahhh! (he starts rubbing his wrist)
2208, does it hurt?," no, i just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (he runs over to where his pants are hanging) hello sweet pants!"
2209, wait a minute! what are you gonna tell joanna?, about what?
2210," when she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that i let you out, and that i was in here, and i’m gonna get fired!"," i’ll make something up! i’m good at lying, i actually did borrow your walkman!"
2211," no, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that i have a key to her office, i’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! (she tries to drag him over to the chair, but chandler stops her.)"," oh-ho-ho, i don’t think so!  well, this is much better."
2212," chandler! chandler, please, i have to get you locked up back the way you were, i am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. now i know why."," hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! okay? if she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. so you might as well just let me go."
2213, what if i clean your bathroom for a month?," it still wouldn’t be clean. (rachel makes an ‘eww, disgusting!’ face) all i want is my freedom."
2214, foot rubs for a month!, freedom!
2215, i’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!," freedom! i want my freedom! why won’t you here me?! (opens the door) sophie, help me! help me!! (sophie stands up)"
2216," sophie sit!!  no! god, would you just calm down!"," i’m gonna say this for the last time. would you please just… (he moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head, which proves his point.)"
2217," i ah, will buy and wrap all of your christmas gifts.", no!
2218, i ah… oh! i’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!, with extra pulp?
2219, (happily) yeah!!  d’oh!! (pause) i’ve got it!, you don’t have it.
2220," i have so got it. there’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. sophie knows, monica and phoebe know.", how do monica and phoebe know?
2221," oh, i called them. and when they ask me what i saw, i can be very generous (holds her hands far apart) or very (in a high pitched voice) stingy.", (intrigued) go on.
2222, i can make you a legend. i can make you this generation’s milton berle., and milton berle has a…
2223," that really means a lot. oh, and mom, don’t bite your nails.", (hello) hello.
2224," (in a sexy voice) hello, chandler. (phoebe has a huge smile on her face.)", (to rachel) i love you. (kisses her on the forehead)
2225, wh-what’s going on?  no he doesn’t!," (checks his watch) two hours, that lasted!"
2226, so did you break up with joanna?, i think so.
2227, with such a sad history., could there be more kims?
2228," hey! new wallet, huh?"," yeah, it was time. the old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore."
2229, (picking up a card from chandler’s wallet.) my god! is this a gym card?,"oh yeah, gym member. i try to go four times a week, but i’ve missed the last 1200 times."
2230, so why don’t you quit?,"you don’t think i’ve tried? you think i like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? no, they make you go all the way down there! then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! then they bring out maria."
2231, who is maria?," oh maria. you can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat."
2232, you need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?  so you’re strong enough to face her on your own?," oh no, you’ll have to come."
2233," no, i made myself take an oath. yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. yeah, that one’s actually from the boy scouts, but it just makes good sense.", why don’t you just give him to somebody else?
2234, wow! and you got a petticure. your feet are all dressed up., because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!
2235," whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.", yes. (in a stronger voice) yes!
2236," one more time, ""hey, don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?""", no! i want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
2237, good! that’s good!, okay. (they go inside) (to the guy at the desk) i wanna quit the gym.
2238, you wanna quit?, i wanna quit the gym.
2239, you do realize that you won’t have access to our new full service swedish spa., (he turns to ross and ross makes a ‘be strong’ sound.) i wanna quit the gym.
2240," sorry, members only.", (horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) i wanna quit the gym.
2241," hey! so, did you quit?"," no, i almost did, couldn’t leave ross there without a spotter!"
2242," oh, umm, i was just y’know working out and umm… oh, that’s it.","we’re doomed. okay, they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. what are we gonna do?"
2243," or! or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.", you’re a genius!
2244," aww, man, now we won’t be bank buddies!"," now, there’s two reasons."
2245," yeah! yeah! yeah! like-like when i’m doing something exciting and i don’t wanna get too excited, i just ahh, y’know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah chandler!"," thank you, joey."

2251," just go up to her and ask her out. (chandler laughs) oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?", i could die.
2252," ross, you guys went out once. you took your kids to chucky cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.", i tell people secrets. it makes them like me.
2253, (entering) oh., hey! (phoebe sneezes)

2255," just be yourself. but, not too much.", (gets up) (softly) wish me luck.
2256, (loudly) good luck!," wish it! (to the woman, kathy, he likes) hi. hi, i-i was just sitting over there, and uhh, chandler. my name is chandler. did i say that?"

2261," hey, i see you guys already met, huh?"," yes-yes, i was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how i could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth."
2262," before i start, i just wanna say that umm, i have a cold, so if i sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. oh, except the last verse of pepper people. (starts to sing) smelly cat, smelly cat. what are they feeding you? (stops singing) this chick sounds good. (singing) smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing) hey gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.", (sees kathy is up watching tv) hi!
2263, hi.," hi. (to phoebe) okay, you’re too late okay? because she’s already with our guy."

2265," you're kidding! oh, i love him."," hey, listen, i'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if i would've known you guys were... i never would've..."
2266, oh please!," so ah, joey tells me you two met in acting class."
2267," yeah, they teamed us up as partners. joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out."," that's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him."
2268, (laughs) oh-oh-oh-oh!, is it on?
2269," no, but this wonder broom is amazing!", hey! (runs over and gets his wonder broom)
2270, oh my god!," and for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! and we don't want to buy your bat! (joey lowers his bat)"
2271, (laughs) what about the duck?, well the duck can swim.

2275," come on, pheebs lay off him."," thank you, ross."
2276, who wants to make some long distance calls?," kathy! kathy! hi!! kathy! kathy! (she doesn't hear him and keeps running, chandler starts chasing her as the theme to the mod squad starts to play. first, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) kathy! (he keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) fetch! fetch it! (he frees himself and resumes the chase) kathy! kathy! kathy! (he now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. he gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) kathy! (he jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) kathy."
2277," hey, chandler! what are you doing here?"," oh, i just wanted to say, ""hey!"""
2278," phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.", (entering) okay. you were right. i'm in love with joey's girlfriend.
2279," well, how-how-how is that possible? you barely know her!"," i don't know. i can't--i just, i can't get her out of my head. y'know? i mean, i'm a very bad person. i'm a very, very bad person. i'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) no you're not chandler! we still love you chandler!"
2280, (to chandler) we were just talking about you., really?!
2281," yeah-yeah, i told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet."," (laughs) right in there! 99...100! ready or not, here i come! (he opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) all right, let's go over the concept one more time."
2282," hey guys. (to chandler) listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and kathy tonight?"," ohh, umm, y'know what, i already ate."
2283,it's 4:30.," y'know i had a big meal on monday, y'know. so that's just gonna get me straight through the week."
2284," okay, i see what's going on here.", you-you do?
2285, yeah! you don't like kathy., you got me.
2286," yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. look, i made an effort to like janice, now i think it's your turn to make an effort to like kathy by going out to dinner with us. right?", yeah. right.
2287, (to chandler) so? huh? what do you think?," ohh, she's-she's not really my type."
2288, not your type?! she's gorgeous!, y'know what i think it is? it's the fishnet stockings. y'know? whenever i see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
2289," okay. understanding a little more why you're single. ohh! y'know, i have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. and then we could double date!"," uhh, no-no thanks."
2290," okay, i've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too."," listen, i-i'm gonna grab a beer. (leaves)"
2291, (to kathy) i'll be right back. (to chandler) what was that?  kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. i thought we had a deal.," hey, look, what do you want from me?"
2292," i want you to like her! but if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.", i am pretending.
2293," well then, do it better!"," okay, what do you saw i go over there and say how much i like her? (joey gives him a thumbs up) no-no it'll be good, i can tell her much i've been thinking about her. that i haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment i met her. that i'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day i can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!"
2294," (opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board over the `little general.') hey! (chandler turns down the tv) now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?", can i sleep on your couch?
2295, hey what are you guys looking at?, ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
2296," probably the only time i'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?"," where did you, when did you, how did you... (joey hits the back of chandler's head) how did you get a girl like that?"
2297," actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era."," okay, but that's, like, the easiest era."
2298, fine by me; hope she wins., hi. you guys have any wrapping paper?
2299, oo! is it for my birthday present?," phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago."
2300," yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?"," well, i have a call in about that."
2301, 'kay.," actually, this is for kathy's birthday. it's an early edition of her favorite book."
2302," oh, the velveteen rabbit! oh my god, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!"," okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils."
2303," huh. well, then you'd better keep it away from ross's hair. so this is pretty rare. how did you get that?"," oh, it wasn't a big deal. i just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren."
2304," yeah, and what a great way to say, ""i secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!""", it doesn't say that. does it?
2305, how do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend joey gives her an orange?," okay, all right, i'll just uh, make sure that uh, joey gets her something really great."
2306," ahahaha... haha.. yes i can, of course. excuse me."," it's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (kathy goes into the bathroom.) hey joe! what are you getting kathy for her birthday?"
2307, you know what we should all do? go see a musical., (confused) sure...
2308,and you know which one we should see? the 1996 tony award winner. do you happen to know the name of that one?," i don't know... um, grease?"
2309, no...., rent?
2310, yes! rent!," okay, so when do you want to go?"
2311," (entering the apartment) hey. man, it is so hard to shop for girls."," yes, it is, at office max."
2312, what did you get her? (joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.), a pen.
2313, it's two gifts in one. it's a pen that's also a clock! huh?, huh-huh! you can't give her that.  because she's not eleven! and it's not the seventh night of hanukkah!
2314," sure it is! she needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... ""whoa! it's time for my date with joey!"""," all right, look, look. what did... what did you get for angela delveccio for her birthday?"
2315, she didn't have a birthday while we were going out., for three years?
2316," (whining and heading toward the door) look, it's too late, and i got an audition. i can't shop anymore! i..."," all right. i will go out and i will try to find something for her, okay?"
2317," thanks, man. and oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?", would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
2318," all right! now you go get that beautiful pig! (ross hesitates, looks unsure) oink!"," okay, all right. i just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for kathy that would be better than the rabbit."
2319, any luck?," oh, yeah. yeah, i found this great place called ""invisible things for kathy."" (motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) can you give me a hand with all this stuff?"
2320," all right, look. why don't you just return the book, let joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. like... a regular pen."," she's really going to love this, you know? the bottom line is i want her to have it, even if i don't get to be the one who gives it to her."
2321," aw, honey, that's so sweet.", yeah? you don't think it's just pathetic?
2322, (entering) hey! i'm meeting kathy in ten minutes! i've been looking all over for you!, where?
2323," our place, the hall! i..."," i got something for her. (joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) it's a book!"
2324, (unimpressed) a book? (suddenly interested) is it like a book that's also a safe?," no, it's a book that's just a book, okay? it's an early edition of the velveteen rabbit. it was her favorite book as a kid. so, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?"
2325," you got it. thanks man. thanks for doing this, i owe you one. (joey leaves, comes back in.) oh, hey! there wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?"," no, it came out to an even twenty."
2326, (screaming with excitement) aah!," hey, how'd it go? how'd she like the gift?"
2327," oh, man, she loved it! she's over there showing monica and rachel right now.", oh yeah? that's great!
2328," hey, listen, i gotta tell ya, i feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am i gonna get a lot of credit for this!"," [nodding, with mixed feelings] aahhuuhhh...."
2329," you know, uh... [joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] chandler got you a gift, too.", no he didn't. [moving it back.]
2330," yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! ha-ho-ho!", happy birthday! i'm sorry.
2331, you really didn't have to. (opens the box) wow.," see, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock."
2332," yeah. no, this is great. thank you, chandler. (they hug)."," oh, yeah... yeah."
2333," oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. (tries to strike a sexy pose up against the doorway to his room. then goes inside).", [to kathy] goodnight.
2334," um, thank you for the gift."," oh, uh, yeah... i just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time."
2335," no, i... i didn't mean the pen. thank you for the book."," uh, the book?"
2336, the velveteen rabbit. i kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it., what do you mean?
2337," well, uh, when joey gave it to me, he said, ""this is 'cause i know ya like rabbits, and i know ya like cheese."" thanks. i love it. and i know how hard it must have been for you to find."," (tongue-tied) uhl..ell. by the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, ""uhl, ell."""
2338, you must really like... joey... to go to all that trouble for him.," oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend."
2339, well...., goodnight. (goes to his room.)
2340," yeah. anyway, he told me about your apartment. and, um, i couldn't sleep, thinking about it. so, uh, would it be okay if i cleaned it?  no?", (entering in a bathrobe) i just walked in the bathroom and saw kathy naked! it was like torture!
2341," y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise."," it just keeps getting worse and worse! y'know? i mean it’s bad enough that i’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, i think she knows. because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. and call me crazy, but i think she likes me too. and now i have seen her naked. i mean at least when i’ve seen her with clothes on, i could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. but there are no boles, she’s smooth! smooth! (leaves)"
2342, great! (leaves), (rushing up) hey-hey-hey! who was that?
2343, that would be casey. we’re going out tonight.," goin’ out, huh? wow! wow! (does a little celebration dance) so things didn’t work out with kathy, huh? bummer."
2344," no, things are fine with kathy. i’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with casey.  yeah-yeah. and the craziest thing is that i just ate a whole pizza by myself! (laughs)", wait! you’re going out with kathy!
2345, yeah. why are you getting so upset?," well, i’m upset—for you. i mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (he can’t believe he just sad that.)"
2346, what is the big deal? it’s not like we’re exclusive.," look, joey, kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. but casey, i mean granted i only saw the back of her head, but i got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you."
2347, you got all that from the back of her head?," all right look, i think it’s time for you to settle down. y'know? make a choice, pick a lane."
2348," no, you guys, i mean my keyboards are all the way up in—no, yeah, okay. (runs out.)  okay, guys."," all right! bring it on, you…"
2349," here we go. (plays one note) y’know, i’ve-i’ve never played my stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’s about communicating very private emotions. (plays another note) y’know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. that’s what i’m…", (interrupting) oh my god! play!
2350," (at a loss for words) boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific."," really, bitchin’!"
2351," what are you guys talking about, i loved it! it was soo moving. oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear."," you mean like, music?  yeah, i know what you’re thinkin’! yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.  come in!"
2352," (entering) hey! (sees what’s on tv) oh god, is that baywatch?"," uh yes, but uh, i just watch it for the articles."
2353, so is joey around?," no-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. so uh, come on in. have a seat. bow or stern?"
2354," i uh, don’t really have a preference. you?"," i like it in the stern. (realizes what he just said.) …of the boat. (the phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) hello."
2355," (on the other end at a pay phone) hey, it’s me. listen casey and i were on our way back and had a little car trouble.", what happened?
2356," we broke down on the parkway, so i have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. and hey, listen could you please tell kathy that i’ll be there as soon as i can.", why can’t you tell her?
2357," ‘cause i only have one quarter, and i think my time is about to—(he stops talking suddenly)", joey! joey!!  i thought your time ran out.
2358," me too, but i guess i do have a couple of more—(his time runs out for real)"," (to kathy) uhh, that was joey. he’s running a little late, he says he’s sorry."
2359," oh, okay."," yeah, i think it is!"
2360, so what did you do today?," oh, i had an appointment to get my haircut…"
2361," (interrupting) oh, it looks great!", …and then it got canceled.
2362," well, i could cut it.", really?! you do that?
2363," yeah, i do. of course, i learned at my aunt’s dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?"," dog grooming huh? okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy."
2364, you have really great hair.," well, thanks. i grow it myself. (kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) y’know who also has great hair is joey!"
2365," yes! yeah! joey has great hair! umm, i’m basically done here. just let me get this off your neck.", what-what ‘cha doin’?
2366, checking to see if it’s even., ‘kay.

2390, yeah! joey has the best boyfriend ever!, i kissed kathy.
2391, does joey know?," no. is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this?"
2392," no the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside."," oh, don’t say that! don’t say that. that’s not true. is it?"
2393, he loves you., then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!
2394, i remember you did., god!! (sits down in disgust.) what am i gonna do?!

2412, (answering phone) hello.," (on phone) hey, it’s me. i know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so i just thought i’d try and apologize over the phone. all i… (joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)  look i never should have kissed your girlfriend, but i’m… (joey hangs up the phone again.)"
2413," what is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything… (joey realizes it’s chandler and hangs up the phone in anger.)"," (entering) aww, turkey! aww, giving thanks! aww!"
2414, so are things with you and joey any better?," they couldn’t be worse. i spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me."
2415," i know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, i just… (goes into her bedroom.)"," hey, by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa, ‘cause i wanna trade for her."
2416, i picked her! oh thank god you want her! ooh!, wow! why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
2417," because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. come on, let’s trade!"," oh that’s not true! that’s not true! i got her that backpack and she loved it! i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it… (notices the look on monica and phoebe’s faces.) oh, there was no big dog. all right this sucks! i already got her this briefcase, and i had r.g. put on it… (phoebe looks confused.) her initials…"
2418," well, maybe you could give to somebody else. ooh, like ross geller."," op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase."
2419, who cares? he works in a museum!," hey, what time is it? the big game is about to start!"
2420, (standing in her doorway) people are trying to sleep in here!," monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts."
2421," oh, y’know what, i can’t, it really kills.", well maybe you should put some ice on it.
2422," no, my eye doctor is richard! i can’t go to him when i don’t have a boyfriend!", he’s really picky about his patients.
2423," okay, get out of my kitchen!"," (entering) all right! okay! i think i am making some progress with joey, when i went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (ross is pleased.) i mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it."
2424," so listen ah, i picked monica for secret santa, but i’m already getting her something for chanukah, i was wondering if you wanna switch."," oh y’know what, i was already trying to trade for ah, well, you."
2425," really?! wow! that’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?"," i don’t know r.g., i was thinking something girlie for your office."
2426," yeah, well maybe phoebe will switch with me."," oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets."
2427," oh, that’s not true! i’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.", like?
2428," like uh, that gold necklace i got her last year.", when was the last time you saw her wear it?
2429," well, she wore it all christmas day, and then uh…", big dog?
2430," oh my god, is it really that bad?"," i walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in italian. and i know he only knows the bad words."
2431," i thought you were chandler. but umm, one of who is over there.", hey joe.
2432, ready?, ready!
2433, my folks.," oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?"
2434," i don’t know. i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment.  yeah, y’know at first i thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together i don’t think i…"," hey, look, what do you want me to say? do you want me to say that i’ll stop seeing her?"
2435," look, it’s not about her. okay? but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. and i don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. so, i’ll see ya. (he starts to leave, but chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)"," hey, look, i know what it is to be a friend, i just-i just screwed up!"
2436, yeah! you did! and that’s why i’m leaving.," all right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! okay, they have had a very difficult year! what with the robbery and all!"
2437," when that guy was robbing us, and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what i was doing in there all that time? i was thinking about how i let you down!  yeah! but if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, i wouldn’t have worried about it so much! see you around!"," all right, wait! come on! just wait one second! there has to be something that i can do! something! if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down. (joey looks intrigued) what?"
2438, ewwwww!! ew! ew! ew!," (he is now in the box, in their living room.) sounds like a really bad idea to me."
2439," so now, what exactly is the point of the box?"," the meaning of the box is three fold. one (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what i did. two (holds up another finger), it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey. and three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!"
2440," (he puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to chandler) now, we’ll see.", air hole! air hole!! (ross retracts his hand quickly.)

2443," oh, i’ll get it. (goes over to the door.)", gotcha! (laughs)
2444, that doesn’t sound like thinking to me!, sorry!
2445, y’know i don’t think you should be talking at all in there! i think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!," okay, okay, you got it!"
2446," okay, fine. (she gets up and walks into her bedroom)"," you can’t tell, but i’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!"
2447," all right, look! if this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! this means something to me! and if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!"," you’re right, and i’m sorry! this means a lot to me! i want you to be my friend again! i swear, i won’t say another word tonight."
2448, so are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?, absolutely!
2449," (starting to cry) open the box!! (runs over to do so.)  he can still catch her! come on, get out of there! (he opens the box) get out of there!", so?
2450," yeah, we’re gonna be fine! get out!  yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there."," man, this is…"

2528," so big deal, so joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed."," we share a wall! so either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot."
2529, go on.," all right, all right, i’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. but i’m just doing it for you guys."
2530," yeah, when we’re in the audience he doesn’t talk to us, but he does wave.", why is phoebe singing to carl mulden?

2532," uh-oh, it was bad?"," it was fine, y’know? but she didn’t agree with me as strongly as she agreed with joey. she was more like, ""i see you point, i’m all right with it."""
2533," yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that."," look, you have to help me! okay? i mean, i know what to do with a woman, y’know, i know where everything goes, it’s always nice. but i need to know what makes it go from nice to, ""my god! somebody’s killing her in there!"""
2534," all right, i’m gonna show you something a lot of guys don’t know. rach, give me that pad, please? (she does so and monica starts drawing on it) all right. now…"," look, you don’t have to draw an actual wo—whoa! she’s hot!"
2535," now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (she starts labelling them) you got one, two three, four (chandler is shocked to find out there’s more than three), five, six, and seven!", (shocked) there are seven?!
2536," let me see that. (monica shows her) oh, yeah.", (points to one) that’s one?
2537, it’s kind of an important one!," oh, y’know-y’know what, i was looking at it upside down."

2570, everyday use., fancy.
2571, guest., fancy guest.
2572,"no, 19.", thanks man.
2573, i call monica’s room!, you can’t just call monica’s room.
2574," man, i feel like i’m coming down with something.  yeah. (to chandler) i bet you can’t guess what color my tonsils are? i’ll bet the apartment!"," oh, i would never bet this apartment. it’s too nice."
2575," well, freaked. ‘cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. and! this is frank and alice’s like only shot. like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket."," yeah, but i bet it works."

2577," all right, look, i hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it’s all your fault.  chinadolor bong, come on, we steal that tv guide every week!", i knew it!
2578," i don’t care, i’m not going anywhere."," cool, girl roommate."

2582, awwwww!! (they lean back all the way.) awwwwwww!!!," okay, she is the star of the play. and she is my girlfriend! i get to have sex with the star of the play!"
2583, people can hear you., i know!!  wow! she looks great. doesn’t she?
2584, that is one good looking man!," is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!"
2585," well, kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.","yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!"
2586, that’s a good idea for a business!," i’m totally screwed. okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. y'know it’ll be like, ""so where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, chester?"" and she’ll go, ""no-no-no, it’s chandler."" and he’ll go, ""whatever. ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
2587, (to ross) that-that is a good trick.," all right, look, look, what am i gonna do?"
2588," well okay, so then you’re fine. the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. okay? so as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. it’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.  look, you guys have been to every play i’ve ever been in, have i ever had chemistry on stage?  noooo!!"," so uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?"
2589," y’know what, i don’t know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend."," yeah, i know but…"
2590," no-no, stay right there. (monica stops and joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) gettin’ closer."," okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. which i’m fairly certain are the same thing."
2591, it’s this way? sorry. (he walks past her and she again admires his butt.)," i’m right! right? there was like no chemistry between them. before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! now you know what this means, joey told us what this means!"
2592," all right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. all right? there was some sexual chemistry between them."," come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!"
2593," wasn’t nick funny when he couldn’t get his match lit?  it’s a good play, isn’t it?"," oh, i loved the play. you were great, and nick ditto. clearly you’re having sex with him."
2594," clearly, i’m having sex with him?"," oh come on, it was so obvious! there was no chemistry between you two!"
2595," okay, so let me just get this straight. you’re accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?"," y’know, i-i could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing."
2596," acting! chandler, this is my job! i’m-i’m playing a part in a play! how can you not trust me?!"," well, you can understand, given how we started."
2597," oh, wow. i can’t believe you’re throwing that in my face."," well, that is what happened, and i don’t even see you denying this!"
2598," i’ll tell you what, chandler, why don’t you call me when you grow up!"," yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!"
2599," oh, are we gonna trash that place?", steps! (he opens the door to his apartment to ross and joey looking at the new playboy) slut! (ross and joey quickly hide the playboy behind their backs. chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) you will all be very happy to hear that kathy is sleeping with that guy!
2600, so you were right?," i confronted her, and she didn’t deny it! (pause) i don’t live here! (goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)"
2601, come here.," well, i may be drunk, but i know what she said! then i went over to beefsteak julie’s…"
2602, beefsteak charlie’s?, yes! see you and i have always been like—(motions that they think the same.)
2603," absolutely! and if it doesn’t, can i get the extra ticket?  what the heck is that?", did she call?
2604," no, sorry."," all right, maybe i should call her."
2605," he’s right, what she did was unforgivable."," well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if i was wrong?"
2606, how might you be wrong?," well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?"
2607," dude, tell me she actually told you this."," she did not have to tell me, i saw the play, and there was no heat. back me up here, ross!"
2608, that’s all you’re basing this on?," that’s not backing me up! look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat."
2609," whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! there’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. the lone gunman. communism. geometry.", oh my god!!
2610, (opening the door) hey.," hey. i just, i just wanted to come over to-to say that i’m sorry. y’know? i know i acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and i can completely understand why you were so upset."
2611, oh wow. i really wish you’d call me.," yeah, i know, i-i wish i had too, but y’know i-i think this is a good thing. y'know? ‘cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. y’know, i know for me—(notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.) nick’s pants?"
2612, how’d it go?," well, she wasn’t sleeping with him."
2613, oh good!, she is now.
2614, what are you saying?," i’m saying that she… is a devil woman! y’know i mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with nick! nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! i hate him, i hate her! well, i don’t hate her, i love her. this is all my fault really."
2615, how? how is your fault?," because, i-i should’ve called! y’know if i had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. i threw her at his man nipples!"
2616, great!, oh that’s great!
2617, there are naked ladies there too., (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) would you give me one minute!! please.
2618, oh yay!," y’know, i can’t believe kathy did this too me. i really, thought that she was the one. i tell you what, from now on i’m never getting out of this chair, ever! okay? from now on, this chair is the one! you wanna what else is the one? my sweat pants!"
2619, hey! you’re wearing pants!, that’s right! where are the guys? i’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
2620,it’s 9:30 in the morning!, they got a breakfast buffet.
2621," hello. (listens) oh, hey ross!"," ooh, let me talk to him!"

2624, what? who the hell is emily—(realises) noooo!!  they’re in vermont!! how could this happen?! (she waves her arms franticly and hits chandler.), ow!
2625, how—how did end up in vermont with that awful witch?! (she hits chandler again.)," maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time."
2626," i don’t get this! she was horrible! (she hits chandler, yet again.)"," okay, i’m going to go stand over there. (points and moves into the living room.)"
2627," oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing!! (storms out.)"," so y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?"
2628, a couple of days.," y’know, i knew something like this was going to happen. (he starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)"
2629, what are you doing?! chandler! you can’t just go back a phase!," yes you can. you’re thinking about time, you can’t go back in time."
2630," yeah, come on, we can be guys!", (laughs) no you can’t.
2631, come on! let us be guys! maybe we want to be guys!," you don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long. (starts to go to his bedroom)"
2632," y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!", okay. (starts to cry)

2634, oh! and don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.," ahh, come on! y’know what—y’know what, i think i’m just gonna go home and call kathy."
2635," well, if you think it will help."," no! that was a test! in a couple of hours i’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! and then after that, i’m gonna get so drunk, i’m gonna wanna call janice"
2636, you should! how is she?, ohhh!!
2637," so, we did okay at the strip club, right?"," oh yeah, that was great. thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!"
2638," no, i don’t."," all right, well i’m gonna put my sweats back on."
2639," oh no! wait! wait! okay, y’know what, you were right, you were right. we really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why? because we’re girls.  and do you know what girls are really good at?", stripping!
2640," yeah. and y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too."," okay, look, i’m gonna have to ask you all to leave."
2641, come on! chandler!," look, forget it. we tried, but phase three is a lost cause, okay? those strippers were insanely hot, and i couldn’t picture myself with any of them. (sits back in disgust.)"
2642," oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! i mean when i stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…", (jumping up) phase three! i just achieved phase three!  i am totally picturing you with all those women!

2644," well, are we all together? like in a group?", stop it! you’re killing me! i think i just moved on to phase four!
2645, oh! what is that? what is that?," where i don’t want to have a relationship ever! i just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!  come on, let me see that smile."
2646, i don’t wanna., please?
2647, i wanted to go to the strip club!," i know, i know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. there are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over."
2648," no, happy for you! (hits him harder.)"," all right ladies, here’s what we’re gonna do. (points to a stripper.) you are gonna take off my clothes. (to another two strippers) you two, go get the oils. (to another stripper) and you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, ""chandler’s the king! chandler’s the king!"""

(the guy just nods) all right, listen, i’ve got to wake up!  y'know, i can't believe i'm getting my nails done!  and you said it was gonna be fun! (pause) which it kinda is.  also, you said there would be other guys here. there are no other guys here!"
2652," chandler, there’s a guy right over there. (points to the counter)", that’s a mailman! that’s our mailman! (waves to the mailman) (sarcastic) hi. how are ya?

(she looks and finds a huge nail.) i hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off."," hey, you know who used to have nails like that?"
2654," okay, good. now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?"," (entering, with janice in tow) hello!"
2655, janice?!, isn’t this amazing?

2659, what?! i thought you were crazy about her!," yeah, i know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? like her voice, her laugh, her personality—well, they’re all back! y’know? and she’s picked up like nine new ones!"
2660, so what are you doing bringing her here?! there’s people here!, don’t worry about it. i’m taking care of it tonight. (chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)
2661, you are not. you have never been able to break up with her.," (standing in the door of the fridge) well, i don’t have to break up with her this time. we’re not involved! i’m going to do a pre-emptive strike! i’m going to end it with her before it starts. my ass is like frozen! (closes the fridge.)"
2662," oh boy, i just love to sing!"," yes, i-i know that you do, but i think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing old man river."
2663,"oh, look at us! who would’ve thought that cupid had a station at 14th street nails. (does the laugh)"," (laughs) okay, we have to talk. i’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…"
2664," i know! and i’m just getting out of a marriage, i mean talk about meant to be!", right! i just think that this is happening too soon.
2665," oh, too soon, too schmoon. face it honey, i am not letting you get away this time."," i hear ya. (pause) but! unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!"

2669," ugh, well i will just have to soak up every once of chandler bing until that moment comes.", but i do know that it’s some time tomorrow.
2670, (whispering to ross) janice.," y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack."
2671," ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn’t really leave me much choice. did you?"," well, i-i thought i did but, i-i guess i did not!"
2672," hey-hey, what’s going on?"," oh, i’m packing. y’know i’m-i’m packing ‘cause i’m moving to yemen tomorrow."
2673, thanks for telling me!," i’m only going to pretend i’m moving to yemen, it’s the only way i can get rid off her."
2674," okay, chandler, come on!"," (to janice) okay. (to joey) joey, trade lives with me!"
2675," all right, come on look, ross can take care of himself! it’s not like he’s…chandler!", (from his bedroom) thanks!
2676, wow! if only more people knew.," y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport."
2677," oh please. every moment is precious. y’know? besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving."," well, we’re really not that close. (pause) okay, so i guess this is uh, good-bye then."
2678," on no! no! it’s not good-bye, i’m not leaving until you get on that plane."," okay. then i guess it’s just, wait here then. (hands her the sign that says, wait here."") (to the ticket agent) hi. i need one fake ticket to yemen."
2679, one ticket to yemen?," oh no-no-no, no. no, no, no, i just, i just need a pretend ticket."
2680," i’m sorry sir, i don’t understand.", what would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
2681, are you travelling with a child?," no. all right, y’know what, she’s (points to janice) gonna think that i’m handing you a credit card, but what i’m really gonna do is hand you a library card."
2682, what’s the matter? is something wrong? do you have to stay?, (to the ticket agent) american express?
2683,(on the p.a.) this is the final boarding call for flight 664 to yemen.," well, i-i guess i gotta go."
2684," oh, my bing-a-ling. i’ll wait for you. do you even know how long you’re going to be gone?"," well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."

2686, chandler?  chandler!," janice! there you are! there you are! i had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after i got on the plane!"
2687, no! no! i wanna see you take-off.," well, i then guess i’m going to yemen! i’m going to yemen! (to this old woman also going to yemen.) when we get to yemen, can i stay with you?"
2688, god! ooh! what is that smell? it’s coming from the bathroom. ooh! (she goes to the bathroom.), wow! pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
2689," oh, wait-wait! (reaches into the shower again.) maybe it’s a pickle?!", what are you writing?
2690," well, joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since i don’t have the guts to ask him out, i’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket."," oh yeah? (he grabs the pad and starts reading it.) joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you (pause) never go out of style—what did you throw away?  hi guys!"
2691," oh, we went to see a collection of victorian doorknobs and the cupert-hewitt museum.", without me?!
2692, hey that’s what all my relationships are like.," yes, but in ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it."

(he notices that the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it’s empty and starts to panic.)  (running and banging on chandler’s door) the stripper stole the ring!! the stripper stole the ring!! chandler! chandler, get up! get up! the stripper stole the ring!", (opening the door) what?
2860, the ring is gone!," ugh. just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—ah-ha-ha!! you lost the ring! you’re the worst best man ever!"
2861," dude, this isn’t funny! what am i gonna do?! i go to bed last night, everything’s cool! i wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!", you slept with the stripper?
2862," that ring? when my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her."," so you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (gives joey a little squeeze.)"
2863," oh absolutely! it has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life."," so you might say, it’s a magic ring."
2864, my-my ring? my-my wedding ring? the-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! h-how?! how could this all happen?!," well, i think it all started when you said, ""hey joey, why don’t you be my best man."""
2865," look ross, i am so-so sorry. i-i-i…"," well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?"
2866, did anybody call for security?, (to ross) you be cool. (he opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)
2867, where’s my ring? my dead grandmother’s wedding ring? where is it? where is it?," way to be cool, man."
2868,"okay, who are you? the hardy boys? look, i don’t need to steal some stupid ring, all right? i make $1,600 a week doing what i do; any of you guys make that?", marry me. (both ross and chandler hit him.)
2869, so! things can go wrong! you don’t know! what if he doesn’t make it?!," he will, joe."
2870," no, it’s not. i mean you-you made me your best man and i totally let you down!"," hey, come on, it’s not your fault."
2871," yeah, it is! you wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? y’know what, ross you were right from the start, he (chandler) should be your best man."," no, you should."
2872, (starting to cry) i gotta go check something over here. (he walks away so that they can’t see him cry.), what a baby.
2873," guys, hurry up! the flight leaves in four hours! it could take time to get a taxi! there could be traffic! the plane could leave early! when we get to london, there could be a line at customs! come on!! (she runs back to her apartment.)", six-hour trip to london. that’s a lot of monica.
2874," it’s all london, baby! here we go. (he takes a picture of a less than enthused chandler and starts towards the girls’ apartment.)", you got your passport?
2875," yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. you don’t want to lose that.  ohh!! (runs to his room.)", there it is.
2876," yeah, okay, give that a try!"," (entering, with joey) all right! let’s do it!"
2877, london baby!," okay, ‘cause that’s not gonna get annoying."
2878, (louder) london baby!!," hey, y’know what? i was wrong."
2879," oh, have a great wedding!  oh, hey, chandler i wanna hug you too!", hey! (trots over)
2880," oh, and great! you might as well bring me my book, it’s on the counter in your apartment.", oh. (goes and gets phoebe’s book as rachel comes in from her room.)
2881, fine. you’ll-you’ll watch it on video when we get back.," (entering, with phoebe’s book.) here you go phoebe! here you go phobo! phewbedo! phaybobo."
2882, come on! do something!," i am, i’m ignoring you."
2883," okay, here! (gives him the camera.) i wanna be the on camera guy. all right, first stop, westminster abbey. (joey folds out his ""pop-up"" map of london. all of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)"," oh, what the hell is that?"
2884," it’s london, baby! all right, the hotel’s here. (points to the map.) wait. no, we wanna go… no. i know. (sets the map down.) i’m gonna have to go into the map. (so joey literally steps into the map.)"," okay, if you see a little version of me in there? kill it!"
2885, i got it! (picks up the map and starts walking.) here we go.," okay. listen-listen, we’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?"
2886," all right! westminster abbey! hands down, best abbey i’ve ever seen. hey! (pushes chandler in front of the camera.) okay. what do you think of the abbey, chandler?"," i think it’s great. it’s great. y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place."
2887, really? to what?, to put the camera away!!!
2888, check this out? huh? (joey has this big tall hat with a british flag on the front of it.) yeah. that’s the stuff. what do you think?," well, i don’t have to buy that, ""i’m with stupid"" t-shirt anymore."
2889," well, i like it. here you go. (he pays for the hat.)"," all right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?"
2890," oh, i embarrass you?", how can i answer that when i’m pretending i don’t know you?
2891, he’s just jealous. you’ll fit right in; all londoners wear them!, oh really? then how come no one here is wearing them?
2892, (looks around) they’re all tourists.," all right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
2893, good choice.," okay, wait. all right, that’s it, okay, i’m out of here. i am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (he trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)"
2894," well, i like you less!", hey. (he nods at the hat.)
2895, oh. (takes off the hat.) sorry!," no-no-no, y’know what? i really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, i mean that really wasn’t cool. and if it makes you feel any better, i’ve had a really lousy day."
2896, hi chandler! (waves), that’s… that’s was…
2897," joey says you don’t really like his hat, but i think it’s kinda dashing.", how did you? how? how?
2898, umm…, i’m gonna go to the bathroom.
2899, come on. you gotta help me figure out what to do. okay?  come on. (they leave and chandler sticks his head out.), that was pretty intense huh?
2900," yeah. (pause) hey, i hope ross didn’t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!", (glares at him) i hope he did!
2901," (looking up at the waiter)that’s not food...no, i don’t, no...(taps chandler on the shoulder.) everything's different here...i want to go home. i...i miss my family. i miss the coffee house. i can’t even remember what phoebe looks like."," joey, it’s been three days, okay.. your just a little homesick, okay. would you just try to relax. just, just try to enjoy yourself."
2902, (trying to get up.) wait!! where are you going?! what are you doing?! no!! wait!! (not able to get up.) god!! why am i always pregnant when she does that?!," i’d like to toast, ross and emily. of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or melba toast, if you will. (no one in the room laughs. he starts to get flustered.) okay. i known ross for a long time. in fact, i knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (ross looks embarrassed.) and i thought things were going to work out for him..until the day he over inflated her. (he laughs. jack looks at judy and no one in the room laughs.) ohh, dear god.. (a cellular phone rings.)"
2903," ohh! okay, i’m going to have to kick her ass too."," (continuing his toast.) and i’m sure we’re all very excited that ross and emily are getting married at montgomery hall. i mean to think, my friend getting married in monty hall. (no reaction from the people.) ohh, come on!! monty hall!! lets make a deal!! come on, you people!! all right, forget it!! congratulations, ross and emily. (he sits down.)"
2904, i was laughing. (patting him on the knee.), out loud?
2905, well i didn’t want everyone to think i was stupid., so how are you doing?
2906," all-right fine, but i just want to say, i’m not paying for your wine cellar. you thieving, would be speaking german if it weren’t for us, cheap little man. (emily’s stepmum looks shocked. jack and judy get up and leave.)"," the guy was hammered, okay? there’s no way, you look like ross’s mother."
2907, then why would he say it?, because he’s crazy. okay? he came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in titanic.
2908," oh, my mother’s right. i’m never going to get married."," ahh, you know what? that is....who wouldn’t want you?"
2909, (screaming) i’m getting married today!! whoo-hoo!!," (with the covers pulled up to his chin.) morning, ross."
2910," i’m getting married, to..day!!", yeah you are!!
2911, (comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) do you think he knew i was here? (chandler quickly looks at monica not knowing what to say.), well i’ve-i’ve never done that with you before.
2912, (in am uneasy voice.) nope. (she chuckles uneasily.)," so, ahh, how are ya? how ya...how ya... you okay?"
2913," yep, yep...you?"," yes...yes..uh-huh, you?(looking over at her. she looks back.) we did you."
2914, well...i’d better get going.," oh yea yea, absolutely."
2915, (scoots towards the side of the bed.) could you not look?, i don’t want to look.
2916, have you seen monica?, (very defensive.) i’m not seeing monica.
2917, (with a confused look on his face.) what?  look we’ve got to find her. phoebe just called!! rachel’s coming to tell ross she loves him!!  i know! that’s why we got to find monica!! you know where she is?, no!! okay!! what’s with the third degree?! why don’t you just shine a light in my eyes?! (joey looks totally confused.)
2918, (using a slightly different inflection for each.) i do. i do. i do.," oh yea, your right. it’s the second one."
2919," no!! wait, wait, wait!! oh please, hold it up so i can listen. (joey looks at ross and holds the phone above ross’s shoulder.)", what we did last night was....
2920, stupid., totally crazy stupid. (he nods his head at the people seated.)
2921, what were we thinking?," i’m coming over tonight though, right?"
2922," well, that went well. yeah."," it could’ve been worse, he could’ve shot her."
2923," no, not phoebe, dr. philange. oh no! you have it too!"," oh wow, i hope you don’t take this the wrong way but, i know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, i’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship."
2924, i know. how could we have let this happen?, seven times!
2925," ugh! well, y’know, we were away…"," in a foreign, romantic country…"
2926, i blame london., bad london! (takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
2927," so look umm, while we’re st-still in london, i mean, we can keep doing it right?"," well, i don’t see that we have a choice. but, when we’re back home, we don’t do it."
2928, only here.," y’know, i saw a wine cellar downstairs…"
2929, where were you? we were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?," forget it, that’s off."
2930, that’s true., the man’s got a point.
2931," well, look at that, same thing."," listen, in the middle of everything if i scream the word, ""yippee!"" just ignore me."
2932," oh my god, rachel! hi!"," oh, hello rachel."
2933," ross said my name. okay? my name. ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! (they both just stare at her.) okay, don’t believe me, i know i’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?"," yes, we do. but, we have to change first."
2934," yes, i want to change. and why-why don’t you go down and get us a table?"," yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes."
2935," hello? oh, pheebs! (to them) it’s phoebe!"," oh, yay…"
2936," okay, pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right? ninth grade, right? the obsession starts. all right? the summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. so then…"," (to monica) hey, listen, why don’t we go change in my room?"

2940," look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?"," well, i suppose i’d have to say you!! but, what if we’re watching a movie in here?"
2941, you really think this is okay?," well, ross and emily aren’t gonna use it."
2942," oh, it’s so beautiful. ohh! y’know, i-i don’t know if i feel right about this."," oh mon-mon-mon-mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. the room expects sex. the room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex. all of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser."
2943, (entering) emily?!," nope, not under here!"
2944," no, i’ve looked everywhere!"," well, you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her!"

2952," y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again."," yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (realizes something) y’know, technically we still are over international waters."
2953," i’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe i’ll see you there in a bit?", ‘kay!
2954, can i ask you something?," uhh, no."
2955," felicity and i, we’re watching my giant, and i was thinking, ""i’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."" do you think i’m just wasting my life with this acting thing?  i mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think i’ll ever get there?", yes.

2972," what?! i didn't have a good time in greece! ross abandoned me! okay, i couldn't get a plane out, so i had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, ""oh, mrs. geller, why are you crying?"" i mean, it was sooo humiliating. i felt like such an idiot! i mean, it's all my fault! and you know why, because i make very bad decisions.", oh that's not true.

3014, sure!," if you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard?"
3015," well, y'know i-i-i think i'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend."," why?! i mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, i'd be going like this. (he jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)"
3016," i told her i'd have to think about it. i mean, how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision? (they're all quiet.) i'm actually asking you!"," well, you can't just not see rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends."
3017," yeah! but, he can't not exactly see emily, i mean that's his wife.", that's true!
3018," yeah, but you've known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life.", that's true!
3019," oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (he waves his hand in front of the woman next to him and you can now see his arm on tv.)"," hey, there he is! there he is!"
3020," (on tv.) now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! who cares, y'know? now i got the legs…"," how many times have i told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!"
3021," (entering) hi chandler.  uh, listen, i need that broiling pan that joey borrowed the other day."," oh that was yours? uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars."
3022,"william sonoma, fall catalog, page 27.","expect it in 4-6 weeks. (she starts to leave.) umm, hey, umm, joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves."
3023," y'know what, champ? i think i'll pass.", why?
3024, why? (she hops into the living room and imitates chandler's happy dance.), what's your point?
3025," oh, look-look, joey's on tv! isn't that great? my pledge got joey on tv! oh that makes me feel—oh no! (realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)"," (entering) look, maybe i got carried away before. but there's something you gotta know. if i'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best."
3026, keep talking.," i mean i was nothing before you. call the other girls and ask. which wouldn't take long. but when i'm with you, and we're together, oh…my…god.  oh-aw my god! now, i understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. we're too good! we owe it, to sex!"
3027," well, if we owe it? (she throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into his arms.) oh my… when is joey gonna be home?"," well, i was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (she starts to take off her latex gloves.) oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on."
3028," but, i just cleaned the bathroom."," yeah, why don't we lose the gloves."
3029, yeah. (she takes them off.)," all right, let's show them how it's done.  y'know that wasn't part of it?"
3030, never done that before., nope.
3031, (quietly) hi!, (quietly) hi! (they both start kissing.)
3032, monica? what time is it?,"uhh, 9. (he pushes the clock into the sink.)"
3033, i'm really getting tired of sneaking around.," i know, me too. hey! y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time."
3034, all weekend? that's a whole lotta naked.," yeah, i can say that i have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing."
3035," ohh, i've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in jersey!"," okay, y'know your not though. let's go. (he starts for his bedroom.)"
3036," oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like chandler's conference could've been in connecticut or vermont.", i'm not in charge of where the conference is held. do you want people to think it's a fake conference? it's a real conference.
3037, damn!, what's going on?
3038," (entering) hi, guys!"," uh, hey!"
3039, what's going on?," oh, just like i said. that crazy... bert... roaming the halls. (joey bangs on"

3042," ooh, madlibs, mine! (grabs it.)", condoms?
3043, you don't know how long we're gonna be in here! we may have to repopulate the earth., and condoms are the way to do that?

3045," ooh, chocolates on the pillows! i love that!"," oh, you should live with joey, roll-os everywhere."
3046," come here. (he does, and they kiss.) okay, be right back."," oh yes! monica, get in here! there's a high-speed car chase on!"
3047, we're switching rooms.," (looks at what she's holding and shies away) oh dear god, they gave us glasses!"
3048," no, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! i mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (he glares at her.) come on sweetie, i just want this weekend to be perfect, i mean we can change rooms, can't we?","okay, but let's do it now though, because chopper 5 just lost it's feed! (he grabs their bags and sprints out.)"
3049, i think you'll find this room more to your liking.," okay, great. (he grabs the remote and turns on the tv to the chase.)"
3050, (watching the chase) they say he's only got half a tank left., half a tank? we still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
3051, we're switching rooms again., what? why?
3052," (to chandler) excuse me, umm, can i talk to you over here for just a second?", uh-huh. (he doesn't take his eyes off the tv.)  (turning to face her) yeah.
3053," look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and i'm not gonna let 'em! and we're not a couple of suckers!"," i hear ya, mugsy! but look, all these rooms are fine okay? can you just pick one so i can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you."
3054," okay, this one i like!"," (watching tv, in fact, er is on.) nothing! it's over! dammit! this is regularly scheduled programming!"
3055, can we turn the tv off? okay? do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?," oh, i'm sorry, am i getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
3056," hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!","oh, who should i blame? the nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?"
3057," i don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from albany to canada on a half a tank of gas!", do not speak ill of the dead.
3058," we're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?"," i just want to watch a little television. what is the big deal? geez, relax mom."
3059, what did you say?," i said, ""geez, relax monnnnn."""
3060," yeah, well that's how mad i am!!", damn rollos!
3061," hey, you're back!  how was your conference?"," it was terrible. i fought with (pause) my colleagues y'know, the entire time. are you kidding with this? (throws away another rollo)"
3062," oh, so your weekend was a total bust?"," uh, no, i got to see donald trump waiting for an elevator."
3063," oh, it was awful. (to chandler) i guess some people just don't appreciate really good food."," well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea."
3064, chandler! (motions for him to come outside.), monica. (follows her out.)
3065," okay, i'd like to know how much the room was because i'd like to pay my half.","okay, fine, $300."
3066,300 dollars?!,"yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!"
3067," hi, rach.", hi!
3068, oh no! not that guy! he does look like him though.," okay, ross is in the bathroom."
3069, who cares? you're rachel! (to chandler) who's kip?," kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together."
3070," hey, mr. bing. that uh, hotel you stayed at called. said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.", yes that was mine.
3071, 'cause i figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there., yes that would have made more sense.
3072," (entering) (he clears his throat to get their attention.) hey, rach? sorry to interrupt but umm, phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something."," i just came over to drop off…nothing. so that weekend kinda sucked, huh?"
3073," yeah, it did."," so, i guess this is over.  well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
3074," why, exactly?"," because of the weekend, we had a fight."
3075, chandler that's crazy! if you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—ohhh! (they both realize something there.)," so, this isn't over?"
3076," (laughs) you are so cute! no. no, it was a fight. you deal with it and move on! it's nothing to freak out about.", really? okay. great!
3077," ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (she goes to kiss him.)", (stops her) we're in a relationship?
3078, (shocked) oh! ohh! oh!!," joey, can i talk to you for a second? (he grabs him and starts to drag joey into monica's room.)"
3079, oohh!! ohh! oh-oh-oh! oh-oh!!  ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!, yes. yes. (lets him up.)
3080, how?! when?!, it happened in london.
3081, in london!!!, the reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
3082, but it is a big deal!! i have to tell someone!, no-no-no-no-no! you can't!
3083, i guess i'm done., fun's over!
3084," (entering) hey! hey! hey! hey!! none of that, not while you're living under my roof!  look, just because i know about you two, doesn't mean i like looking at it.", aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
3085, sorry., sorry.
3086," yeah! why would my mother send me a fur? doesn't she know me but at all! plus, i have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!","yeah, just some 9-year-old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. chandler sees her reaction.) that didn't happen, i made that up!"
3087," look, if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york, i'm sure everything will be fine."," okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?"
3088," oh, i hate this. everything's changing."," yeah i know, we're losing ross, joey said hence…"
3089," ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (he drapes it around his shoulders.) enh? all right, what do you think?",you're on in 5 ms. minnelli.
3090, that's way uptown! that's like three trains away! (phoebe pinches him.) which is great! i love to ride that rail!, so you're really okay with this?
3091," yes! yes! i mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, i'll get so much done on the commute. i-i've been given the gift of time!"," now that's so funny, because last christmas i got the gift of space. we should get them together and make a continuum."
3092, (on phone) i know i miss you too. i can't wait to see you. i love you. bye. (hangs up.)," okay, what is in here? rocks?"
3093," no-no, this is my collection of fossil samples."," so, rocks."
3094," no, ross, we do not hate emily. we-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy."," look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable."
3095, i kinda feel like it's my fault., kind of? if you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
3096," well, i'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! (he glares at chandler.)"," well, i think it's very brave what you said."
3097," all right, i can't sit here anymore. i have to walk places. (she puts on her fur coat.)"," pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? how about the whole animal rights thing?"
3098, stop saying that. i hate that.," uh, ross?"
3099," look, ross, i feel really bad. i mean, you're going through all this stuff and i just acted like a jerk."," yeah, we are so sorry."
3100, she's there?!," oh yeah, there-there she is!"
3101," (to the squirrel) okay, stop tormenting me! this mink! okay, they're mean! and they hate squirrels! and y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! (the squirrel stares at her.) all right, fine, now i get it. (to the clerk.) here. (she hands him her coat.) you take it. (to the squirrel.) are you happy now? i'm cold!", are you looking at naked tribe's women?
3102," no, look. (shows him the magazine.)", that's a pig.
3103," i know, i know, but look at the knobs on her.", hey! (joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
3104," emily's cousin kicked me out!  well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.", how can he do that? didn't you sign a lease?
3105," hey, you can stay with us! we'll take care of ya!"," oh, yeah! absolutely! anything you need man! but you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!"
3106," you got it.  thanks you guys, i really appreciate this. all right, i'm gonna get packing again. man, i've been moving around so much i'm beginning to feel like a nomad.", he thought you said gonad.
3107, (entering from the bathroom) hey roomies!, love what you've done with the place.
3108," not a problem. and listen, hey! since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't—i was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.", oh yeah!

3112," dude, you should've gone out once and a while.", i hate this thing!
3113, sorry.  ahhhhhhhhhh…, (entering) hello children!
3114, hey! wanna play some foosball? please?, okay. (starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
3115," no-no, no! we have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'cause of all the boxes. come on!  all right, i have one question. what is the deal with this? (imitates ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)", bye-bye little puppet joey hand?
3116," no, the quiet down thing!", you mean this. (does the maneuver perfectly.)
3117," um-hmm! look, i-i-i don't know how much more of this i can take! did you know he taped over my baywatch tape with some show about bugs! my god! what if that had been porn?"," (gasps) all right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is ross! i survived college with him!"
3118," all right, i guess i can hold out a little longer. let's have a game.", no-no-no-no!
3119," (entering) uh fellas, (does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs up, which chandler returns as he closes the door.)"," okay, so he's out of here."
3120," hey, guys, you know what larry would say? he would say, ""see you ladle."" (laughs.)"," well, i-i-i'm done with this. you want anything ross? sports? international? apartment listings?"
3121," well, i guess i can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.",not even on page 7?
3122," (looks) oh yeah! you're—hey, you're right! here's an affordable place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!", what about that circled one?
3123, but it's available now! isn't it?," yes, it is."
3124," okay, let's go.", there we go!
3125," oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, i was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? i mean after all, we all are using it.", let's go quicker.
3126," oh my god! (looking around, which doesn't take him long.)"," yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. well that's great! y'know so you can cook while in the tub."
3127," but hey, ross, this place is available now!"," yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks."
3128, (to chandler) how about you?, it's a kitchen slash bathroom.
3129," all right, i see what you guys are saying. i'll uh, i'll go downstairs and fill out an application.", we are bad people.
3130," maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping ross get back on his feet!"," yes that was a nice place!  not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!  what are we gonna do?"
3131, i don't know. maybe pizza?, about ross!
3132," oh! oh!  hello! (listens.) oh yeah! (to chandler) it's the apartment manager; ross put us down as references. (to the apartment manager.) ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! yeah, he's very reliable."," (grabbing the phone) of course he has this big huge dog! that uh, barks into the night. (listens.) well, who doesn't love dogs? (thinks.) ah, he's a tap dancer! (listens.) yes, some would say that is a lost art. (thinks.) he's a pimp! (listens.) there you go! yes, he's a pimp. he's a big, tap dancing pimp! (pause.) hello?  ohhhhh!"
3133, i think i need a drink.,"98. 99. 100. okay, go!"
3134," (getting up) dude, i'm telling ya! i'm fine! (he tries to take a step and falls flat on his face.)", here we go! here we go!
3135, you're kidding!," you're kidding, no!"
3136, definitely!," yes! ross, you have to stay!  all right, buddy!"
3137," so i'm a pimp huh? it's okay! look, i know that sometimes i can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. tell me if something is bothering you. okay? and for my part i will do everything i can to keep my annoying habits just (does the 'quiet down' maneuver)."," well, i see you've had a very productive day. don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?"
3138," (popping up behind joey wearing an indian headdress) come on, it's fun!", all right! (he joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) isn't this a woman's hat?
3139, that's very nice.," that's sweet, joey."
3140," yeah, the other day i was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. oh! which reminds me, i'm also thankful for thongs. (note: actually, i think every guy is thankful for thongs. that and spandex. j )  i mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. i mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! and the way they play with your mind! is it there? is it not there?", are you aware that you're still talking?
3141, i'm sorry. it's just that this is the worse thanksgiving ever., no-no-no! i am the king of bad thanksgivings. you can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
3142," oh, come on! i wanna hear it! it wouldn't be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out!"," it's a tradition, like the parade. if the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family."
3143, i don't know about that. i've got one that's worse.," really? worse than, ""more turkey mr. chandler?"""
3144," hey, it's not like it sounds.", it's exactly like it sounds.
3145,"okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!"," arghhhhhh!! (joey turns around to taunt him, but chandler is in the doorway and joey is facing the kitchen.)"
3146," (pointing) it worked! i scared ya, i knew it! ha-ha!", i'm over here big guy.
3147," (turning all the way around, and still not facing chandler) yeah, you are! (starts dancing.) i scared you!", (laughing) you did look like an idiot.
3148," umm, i-i really don't want to tell this story."," oh, come on monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what thanksgiving is all about. y'know, for me anyway. and of course, the indians."
3149," hi, i'm ross's little sister.", (seeing her) okay.
3150," umm, chandler, if you want i can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner."," well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, i'm in."
3151, hey chandler! did you like the macaroni and cheese?," oh yeah, it was great. you should be a chef."
3152, so i’m thinking about asking rachel out tonight. y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.," emotional knapsack?  right on! oh! uh, but, don’t take to long okay? 'cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake id's tonight, right clifford alverez."
3153," listen, roland chang, if things go well, i’m gonna be out with her all night."," dude, don't do that too me!"
3154," all right, it's cool you can stay here. my parents won't mind."," no, it's not that, i just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister."
3155," well judy, you did it! she's finally full!", i called you fat?! i don't even remember that!
3156," well, i do.", i am so sorry. i really am. i was an idiot back then. i rushed the stage at a wham concert for crying out loud!
3157, i can't believe you let george michael slap you.," i am really sorry. that is so terrible. i am so, so sorry."
3158," oh, no, i have the cutest christmas story!", we wanna hear monica's thanksgiving story!
3159," (to chandler) god, your hair sure is different!"," yeah, we were just talking about that. i can't believe how stupid we used to look. (they both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)"
3160," hi, chandler.  what-what's the matter? is there, is there something on my dress? (she turns around making sure he gets a good look.)"," you just, you look so different! terrific! that dress! that body!"
3161," yeah? okay! good, good, because he's coming. he's coming. (to chandler) hey, what's up? (she leaves and closes the door behind her.)"," monica, i was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year."
3162," umm, i'd love too! (she goes over and picks up the box and decides to follow rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) ooh, i love macaroni and cheese. i love-i love the way this box feels against my cheek.  boy, i love carrots! oh! (she picks up a bunch of them and holds them between her fingers.) sometimes i like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while i talk to you. (she is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) umm, and-and-and y'know if i get really hot umm, i-i like to pick up this knife (she picks up a knife without putting the box down. she's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder) and-and umm, i-i put the cold steal against umm, (pause) my body. (she doesn't have any exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)", are you all right?
3163," it's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.", without my toe?! i need my toe!
3164," oh, i'm not falling for that one!", that's why i lost my toe?! because i called you fat?!
3165, i didn't mean to cut it off. it was an accident., that's why for an entire year people called me sir limps-a-lot?!
3166, i'm sorry! it wasn't your whole toe!," yeah, well, i miss the tip! it's the best part. it has the nail. (he storms out.)"
3167, you're a dork., i can't believe this.
3168," chandler, i said i was sorry."," yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! i hate this stupid day! and everything about it! i'll see you later."
3169," oh wait, chandler, come here is there anything i can do? anything?"," yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (he goes into his apartment.)  oh-oh, i'm a duck! i go, ""quack, quack!"" i’m happy all the time!  nice try."
3170," wait, wait, wait! (she puts a shriner's hat on the turkey.)"," look, monica…"
3171," look! (she puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)", this is not going to work.
3172, i bet this will work! (she starts dancing and chandler cracks up.)," you are so great! i love you!  nothing! i said, i said ""you're so great"" and then i just, i just stopped talking!"
3173, you said you loved me! i can't believe this!, no i didn't!
3174," yes, you did!  you love me!", no i don't! stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it!
3175, what am i sitting on?, top of the world? dock of the bay? (he tries to think of another but can't) i'm out.

3179," oh-oh, yeah-yeah, i bet all the sex makes it easier!"," well, yeah actually."
3180," we'll try to be more careful okay? it's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret."," i know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships."
3181, we are! help us!, help!
3182," hey, phoebe!"," hi, pheebs!"
3183," umm, wethering heights. i'm taking a literature class at the new school and i have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.", i didn't know you were taking a class. that is so cool.

3185, my thanksgiving leftover sandwich. i can't believe someone ate it!," ross, it's just a sandwich!"
3186," (quietly) that-that would be incredible. thank you so much. i-i still can't believe someone ate it!! i mean, look, i left a note and everything."," (reading) knock-knock. who's there? ross geller's lunch. ross geller's lunch, who? ross geller's lunch, please don't take me. okay?"
3187," really?! so what would you say pheebs? stuff like uh, ""keep your mitts off my grub?"""," say ross, when you picture phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of annie?"
3188," joey, is what she just said umm—oh my god. (looks around the room.) you were actually gonna… (chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.) (rachel stares in shock.)", what is going on here?
3189," well, i'm telling everyone about you! that's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!"," no-no, wait! there's got to be a better explanation. you can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (thinks) adult film class."
3190," yeah, i like that. but no-no, how does that explain why rachel found my underwear at your place?", oh—i don't know.
3191," hey. okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, i thought that i would give you just a little preview. (hands him a polaroid.)", (gasps) you're naked in this picture!  ross?
3192, i'm fine! i saw a psychiatrist at work today.  on account of my rage.," which i may say, right now, is out of control."
3193," wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?", and you're okay with that?
3194, joey has got a secret peephole!, (sees the picture) oh no! no! no! no! (monica gasps as well.)
3195, no! i am not a pervert! okay? it's just… i just… kinda…," all right, look! look. i think i can explain this."
3196, thank you!," if you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!"
3197, (thinking) i slept with monica., well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?
3198, my god monica!!, are you sure joe? are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
3199," ohh, no, no. we’re not going to just sit. (joey sits down and hits the speed dial button on the phone.) shhh. (it begins to ring.)"," (answering the phone at work) hello, chandler bing."
3200, (in a high pitched female voice) hello mr. bing...i love you.," (angrily) alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (ross and joey laugh silently.) it’s been six months! it’s not funny!"
3201," but, i love you."," leave me alone! for the love of god, leave me alone!!! (joey hangs up.)"
3202," hey you guys, guess what?", the british are coming?

3204," hey, how do you spell suspicious?  because i think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.","yes! chandler bing, 7! chandler bing, 0."
3205, you're driving me crazy with that!," okay, i'll stop."
3206," don’t stop! move the bowl further away! ross could make that shot!  well, you suck! but at least you suck at a man's game now.", you wanna play?
3207," chandler, i can't be playing games, ross is gonna be home soon. and i have to write five whole pages if i'm gonna stick to his schedule.","well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home."
3208," (jumping up) all right! but uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?", i'm intrigued.
3209," all right, all we need is a little lighter fluid."," okay, but be careful okay, because i wanna get our security deposit back."
3210," yeah, i think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.", do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
3211," yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing."," (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) oh yeah, it's great! see you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid—op! op! (he puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)"
3212," okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. that helps a lot. thanks. (she leaves them to wrestle.)","(entering from his bedroom) guys, come on! let's go! the puck drops in 20 minutes! come on, joe!"
3213, (to chandler) i didn't finish my five pages.," well, why can't you do them tomorrow?"
3214, yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.," (to ross) why don't you cut him a little slack? okay? maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done."
3215," dude, if you think fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played."," the only reason you're doing this to joey is because you're bored. okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed."
3216," and the reason i'm doing this is because i am joey's friend. and if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing."," oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?"
3217," how about we settle this right now! (he rips up the tickets.) there! now, no one's going to the game. ha-ha-ha!", i paid for those tickets!
3218," no you didn't. you said you would, but you never did!", oh yeah! (makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
3219," oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.", when did that happen to you?!
3220, don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—i didn't have my camera!," oh yeah. first off all, chasing the churo guy isn't jogging."
3221," yeah, wow, sorry rach.", i don't believe they're brother and sister.
3222," yeah, okay, i'll see you later. (gets up and runs from the apartment.)"," oh hey! there's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?"
3223, (entering) hey guys! i was at the library all morning and i already finished my five pages for today!," great! now, we can go to the ranger game! (pause) last night!"
3224," i guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. huh?", yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck all the live long day!!
3225," yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that i finished it. and uh, i think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if i could hear it. so would you guys read it for me?", all right. (takes a copy.)
3226," okay. (reading.) ""it's a typical new york city apartment. two guys are hanging out."" ross (points to him.)", what is up?
3227," about yesterday, i was really wrong. i am sorry."," no, it was me. i'm sorry. i over reacted."
3228," maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest… (pauses and looks at joey.) but we had our best friend's interest at heart.", could i be more sorry. (looks at joey.)
3229," i don't know, i'm one sorry polentologist. (stops reading.) all right joey, we get it. (to chandler) i'm sorry.", (to ross) i'm sorry too.
3230," (reading from the script.) i am sorry, chandler."," i am sorry, ross."
3231," a handsome man enters. (playing the part of the handsome man.) hey! how's it going guys? i don't know what you two were talking about, but i'd like to say thanks to both of you. you, (ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (chandler) well you co-created fireball. the end.", this took you all day?!
3232,all right! here we go! 1999! the year of joey!," (deadpan, standing next to monica) we're very happy for you."

3235,"just the one divorce in '99! y'know what, i am gonna be happy this year. i am gonna make myself happy."," do you want us to leave the room, or?"
3236, ooh! that's a good one! mine is to pilot a commercial jet.," that's good one too, pheebs. now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths."
3237,"in fact, i'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. eh, y'know what, better yet? a week.","i'll take that bet my friend. and you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the ""new thing you do that day!"" (ross looks at him.) and it starts right now!"
3238, i just asked that girl out., nice!

3240," that's right, uh, elizabeth hornswoggle.", horn-swoggle.
3241, you all right chandler? is there something funny about that name?," no. no, i just think that maybe i-i'd heard it somewhere before. (sits down rubbing his temple.)"
3242,"okay, lesson one: chords. now, i don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, i-i-i made up names for the way my hand looks while i'm doing them."," what an interesting approach to guitar instruction. y'know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular."
3243, auntie monica!! (he runs to hug her.)," (notices something) ross is wearing leather pants! does nobody else see that ross is wearing leather pants? (pause, no one speaks.) someone comment on the pants!"
3244, i like them a lot.," that's not what i had in mind! see, people like ross don't generally wear these types of pants. you see, they're very tight. (motions to ross's buttock.) maybe there's something in that area."
3245," oh see, i-i needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and i thought to myself, ""wow, (to chandler) i never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before.""", oh come on!! (storms out.)
3246, (on phone) i can't wait to be with you! i'll sneak over as soon as ross picks up ben. i'll just tell rachel i'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.," (on phone) laundry. huh. is that my new nickname? (rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)"
3247," okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, i think i'm, i'm gonna go do my laundry."," oh yeah, me too. y'know if this shirt is dirty. (smells it.) yep."
3248, that's weird. (pause.) i bet they're doing it.,"(entering) oh good, okay, i can't take it anymore. i can't take it anymore. so you win, okay? here! (hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) pheebs? flying a jet? better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! and ross, phone call for you today, tom jones, he wants his pants back! and hornswoggle? what are you dating a character from fraggile rock?! (he sits down and sighs in relief.)"
3249, what? oh!, sorry man.
3250," oh, thanks gunther. (he takes it, hands the plate it's on to rachel, sets it down on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) stupid british snack food!!!!!!!", did they teach you that in your anger management class?
3251," look at us all dressed up for the big office party! by the way, what are we celebrating?"," oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the christmas party."

3253," hey bing! (slaps him on his ass.) (sees monica) wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?"," i asked myself that very question, sir. uh, (points to monica) this is monica. (points to his boss.) this is my boss, doug. doug this is monica."
3254," say uh, bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?"," no, sir."
3255, what was that?  that noise you just made?," oh, that was my work laugh."
3256, really? your work laugh?," oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too."
3257,…says $30 father; same as in town.," hey! everybody at work loved you last night!  and! they like me more just because i was with ya! i think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met joey. and doug wants us to play tennis with them. he's never even talked to me outside of work. except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. (she glares at him.) strip church. anyway, i'm gonna go try and find a racquet."
3258," hey, i thought you already had one."," oh i used too, but then joey thought it would be fun to go to central park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks. (he starts to leave and stops an entering rachel.) hey rach, do you have a tennis racquet?"
3259," oh umm, y'know i lent it to joey and i never actually got it back."," okay, good luck with that. (exits.)"
3260," am i on fire today or what?! those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!"," okay, easy martina. i think we should let them win the next game."

3262," are you crazy?! we own those two! i mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.", you're not even giving them a chance!
3263," uh bing, i think we're gonna make this the last game."," oh yes, sir! put me out of my misery. are you sure you never played pro? (does his work laugh.) (to monica) please let them win!"
3264,i'll take it down to 95% but that's the best i can do.," oopsey, missed it!"
3265, i got it!!, long! (gives monica the work laugh.)
3266, i can't believe you let them win!," yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)"
3267, i was frustrated., it was my racquet.
3268, i was frustrated with you!, if we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
3269," y'know what really bothers me? is—it's how-how different you act around them! i mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the ""i'll see you around, bing!"" ""not if i see you first, doug!"" (mocks the fake laugh.) i gotta tell you, i don't like work chandler. okay? the guy's a suck-up."," okay y'know what, because you said that, i'm not putting out tonight."
3270," oh, none for me. thanks.", just a little bit of sugar.
3271, (to chandler) how does that laugh not give you a headache?," oh, you get used to it."
3272," y'know, i-i-i don't think that i can. so if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things."," so i laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?"
3273, i'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when i can be hanging out with my boyfriend who i actually respect., oh. (does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
3274," (entering) uh, i gotta apologize for kara's coffee. y'know, i feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. (chandler does not laugh.) did you hear what i said bing?  the joke bing. what's the matter with you?"," well, i-i just didn't think it was funny sir."
3275," (interrupting) honey, i just don't think that you understood the joke.  yeah! i mean it was really funny, i-i just don't think you got it. you see kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? but-but what doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. you get it now honey?"," i think i do! (they all laugh.) thank you, monica."
3276, i thought you could use the help., coffee in a fight! (does the laugh again.)
3277, what?! she just called and said that she was gonna be working late! she keeps lying to me! that's it! y'know what? i'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!," (from his bedroom) all right, so you're telling me that i have to tell racist jokes now?!"
3278, sorry! i'm just—i'm not very good at this! i'm a terrible liar and i hate having to lie to rachel!, but we're not ready to tell yet!
3279, 'kay. (pause.) congratulations on your new job. (she goes and hugs monica and is almost in tears.)," man, she is really gullible."
3280," dude, we got to talk.  i just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and i hope this isn't too weird, but uh, i had uh, a thing with janice. (he laughs, his real laugh this time.) what you're-you're not mad?", why would i be mad?
3281," well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. you don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to."," (realizes what ross just said and the implications to him) i am mad! but you know what i'm gonna do? i'm gonna forgive you! because that's what friends do! they forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. well, but i want you to remember that i forgave you.  i also want you to remember that i let you live here rent free!  and, i want you to remember that i gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. no strings attached. now, if you can't remember that, i think we should write it down—let's write it down!"
3282, i can't believe we've never done this before! it's sooo good! so good for monica!," oh! look at that, time's up! my turn!"
3283, that was a half an hour?, it's your timer.

3285," it's so good, isn't it?", it's so good i don't know what i've done to deserve it!
3286, say good-bye to sore muscles!," good-bye muscles!!  i'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. and i wanted to give it up i just—i didn't know what it was!"
3287," chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her."," look, for the first time in my life i'm in a real relationship. okay, i'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth."
3288," whoa, dude, look out! you almost crushed my hat! (he picks a hat up from the floor. it's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)", (examining the hat) and the bunny got away. (turns and starts looking for the bunny as joey puts the hat on.)
3289," oh! yeah, look there's this play all right? and i'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. a real clothes horse. so i figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.", and you're gonna make them all disappear.
3290," yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.", done.
3291, thanks! enjoy your funeral., wow! you look just like your son mrs. tribbiani!
3292," here, i brought you some flowers. (he pulls them out of the bag.)", pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
3293," ahhh, i think you look great! that bag is gonna get you that part.", and a date with a man!
3294, no he's not!," (wincing) yes, he is!  i'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!"

3297, (starting to cry) see? it's no big deal.," okay, but now see you're crying!"
3298, i'm not crying about that! i'm crying about something that happened at work.  (bursting into tears) my boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.," it's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything."
3299, oh my god! you don't know me at all!," okay, you give the worst massages in the world."
3300, i'm crying here!!," okay, hear me out. okay? you give the best bad massages. if anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, ""who's the best of that?"" they'd have to go to you."
3301," huh. so you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?"," oh, it would be you! you! monica! and you'd get all the votes!"

3311," okay, now you're even cuter!!"," y'know that is a popular opinion today i must say.  the weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, i think, i think phoebe was hitting on me.  i'm telling you i think phoebe thinks i'm foxy."
3312," that's not possible!  i'm sorry it's just, phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way."," oh, y'know i-i can't hear that enough."

3321," uhhh, phoebe and joey.  and rachel. i would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!", oh man!
3322," oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! but see they don't know that we know that they know! so…"," ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"

3333," no, i want this to happen.", so do i.  i'm gonna put on some music.
3334," maybe, maybe i'll dance for you. (she starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)", you look good.
3335," thanks! y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!"," well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?  oh, do you not want to?"
3336," no. no! it's just y'know first, i wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me."," (swallowing hard) well that would be nice. i'll go get the lotion.  listen, this is totally getting out of hand! okay? she wants me to put lotion on her!"
3337, she's bluffing!," look, she's not backing down! she went like this! (he does a little mimic of her dance.)"
3338, you go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!," okay, give me a second! (pause) did you clean up in here?"
3339, of course.," oh, you're-you're going?"
3340," umm, not without you, lover. (she slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) so, this is my bra."," (swallowing hard) it's very, very nice. well, come here. i'm very were gonna be having all the sex."
3341, you should be. i'm very bendy. (pause) i'm gonna kiss you now.," not if i kiss you first.  well, i guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
3342, here it comes. our first kiss., okay! okay! okay! you win! you win!! i can't have sex with ya!
3343, and why not?!, because i'm in love with monica!!
3344, you're-you're what?!," love her! that's right, i…love…her!!! i love her!! (they walk together and hug.) i love you, monica."
3345, dude!, and hats off to phoebe. quite a competitor. (pause) and might i say your breasts are still showing.
3346," well actually, ross doesn't."," yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
3347," oh donald that-that would be great. i am totally ready to come back to work. i—what? (he notices something through the window.) no! wh… what are you doing?!! (dr. ledbetter is slowly backing away.) get off my sister!!!!!!!!!!!!!  chandler!!! chandler!!! (he opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; chandler and monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) chandler, i saw what you were doing through the window! chandler, i saw what you were doing to my sister! now get out here!"," (to monica) wow! listen, we had a good run. what was it? four? five months? i mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! so, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (he kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)  oh, i'm going on the lamb."
3348," (running from the guy's apartment with joey in tow) hey, what's-what's going on?!"," well, i think, i think ross knows about me and monica."
3349," (to chandler) i thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! my best friend and my sister! i-i cannot believe this!"," look, we're not just messing around! i love her. okay, i'm in love with her."
3350," hey, you know what i just realized? if you guys ever have kids…", (interrupting) whoa-whoa-whoa! we're having kids?!
3351," guys, you're a few steps ahead of us."," yeah, big zero gravity moon steps."
3352," i know what you need, you need a bodyguard. hey ross, what is ben doing after preschool?"," hey listen, come on, joey is having a problem! a little girl is beating him up."
3353," …so then president steve told everyone that i was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! a little kid spit on my knee! y'know what i'm gonna do? i'm gonna throw a party. that's right. for everyone in the building, and i'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, i am not a bad guy. i am not a cheap guy! i'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. a man with principles.", (to rachel) sounds like a fun party.
3354, and that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.," very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of monica. i don't want you putting any ideas in her head."
3355," umm, chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica's head.", wh-wh-why?!
3356," well, because she loves you and because you love her."," yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!"
3357,"hey, chandler, don't freak out! i'm telling you something you already know! come on, she broke up with richard because he didn't want to have babies. and she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's monica."," i don't see it that way. okay? because, i see two monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new monica, who i just started to date. now, who's to say what she wants?! i’m right. i'm right. am i right?"
3358," no, you're right, you are absolutely right. i mean that makes, that makes everything different."," okay. it's not different at all, is it?"
3359, isn't this great?, hmm.
3360, couldn't you just stay like this forever? (his eyes snap open.) chandler! couldn't you just stay here forever?," yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (gets up.)"
3361, are you okay?," yeah, i'm cool. casual."
3362, what-what are you doing?," i'm just hanging out. y'know, having fun. y'know with the girl that i'm seeing casually."
3363," man, i knew it! i knew you were going to do this!!  get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff."," well, you do want all that stuff, right?"
3364, oh and you know what i want!, yes! you want babies! you have baby fever!
3365, i do not have baby fever!," oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! i've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!"
3366," have you lost your mind? chandler, this isn't about me! this is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!", nah-uh! i know you! okay? i know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
3367, you don't know everything. did you know that i'm going out with rachel tonight instead of you? hmm? and did you know that the only baby around here is you?! and did you know that i can't even look at you right now?! (she storms out.)," well, i did not know that.  it's gonna be okay, right? i mean she's not gonna leave me? this is, this is fixable."
3368," oh yeah, yeah, sure. absolutely.", by me?
3369," gunther, can i get a coffee (looks at chandler) to go?", monica. (goes to talk to her.)
3370, i'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.," just tell me what i need to do to make things right.  well, that's what we do. y'know, i-i mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then i do and then y'know you think i'm all cute again."
3371," oh wow, yeah! see, i did not get that.", where's monica?! where is she? i need to talk to her! it's urgent! is she here?
3372, (raising her hand) i'm monica.," i need to talk to you, it's urgent!  okay, i've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. and uh, well i guess there's only one-one way to do this. (he slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)"
3373, wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!, (getting out a ring box) monica…
3374," no-no, don't-don't-don't do it!", will you marry me?
3375," chandler, why are you doing this?", i don't know. but i know i'm not afraid to do this.
3376," do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?"," no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (laughs.) will you be my wife?"
3377," (kneels with him) chandler, umm, i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds."," yeah, i'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now."
3378, honey! do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now!," yeah i know, but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys. (turns to look at ross and joey.)"
3379," y'know what? y'know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? well, you're not ready for that.", i didn't think i was!
3380," oh my god, what would have done if i said yes?"," well i would've been happy because i would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love. or, you would've seen a chandler shaped hole in that door. (points at the door.)"
3381," oh no wait pheebs, i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. but i'm not sure, chandler?"," okay, how long is this going to go on."
3382," this is fun. hey rach, remember that whole ""we were on a break thing?"" well, i'm sorry, will you marry me? (laughs--whines as he sees that no one is laughing. they're just staring at him in shock.)", that's not funny.
3383, that's not funny at all!  what are you guys doing up?," oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?"
3384, (thinks) dark red.," yeah, i think that's wrong, but there's a connect the dots in here for you later. (to monica) hey, how about maroon?"
3385," okay, dime! (donates that.) you guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. (finds something else.) oh no, wait! look it! whoa! (looks at it.) oh my god, this is a police badge!"," oh that's so cool! why would a cop come in here though? they don't serve donuts. (no one laughs.) y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? i think i can come up with something better than that."
3386, what's with him?," oh, y'know what? the last time joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter."
3387, i know but i'm having so much fun doing good deeds.," okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. you could get arrested."
3388, (to phoebe) hey! (sees that monica's there.) oh.," hi, joe."
3389, nothing!," oh, come on! you've been acting strange all day!"
3390," all right! there is something. i kinda had a dream, (pause) but i don't want to talk about it. (starts for his room.)", whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if martin luther king had said that? (imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) i kinda have a dream! i don’t want to talk about it.
3391," well, it involved monica."," you had a dream about a girl that i am seeing?! oh, that is so cool! (to monica) i can't tell you how many times i've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (seeing monica's stare.) (to joey) anyway we're talking about your dream. (to monica) i love you. (to joey) your dream? (leans in to listen closely.)"
3392, it-it doesn’t?," no, it can mean anything. like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because i've become the apartment stud."
3393, in the dream i did enjoy the closeness.," joey, look, are you attracted to monica? right here, right now, are you attracted to her?"
3394, (looks at her) not really., well there you have it!
3395," no, i don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. y'know? i mean, yeah, i can get a girlfriend! yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?"," well y'know, monica and i were friends before we started dating. so maybe-maybe that's it?"
3396," (entering) hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?"," oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom."
3397, chandler?! you brought chandler?! the next best thing would be monica!," y'know, i would be offended, but monica is freakishly strong, so…"
3398, no! that's-that's my arm!," (looking at the sketch) oh, i see. i thought you just really, really liked your new couch."
3399," y'know what? just-just follow my lead.  come on, chandler.  all right. (they start up the stairs. ross is first.) okay, here we go!  all right, ready?  turn.", (straining) okay.
3400, turn! turn!," okay, i don't think we can turn anymore!"
3401," oh yeah it will! come on, up! up-up-up! up! yes! here we go! pivot! (they start up the stairs again. chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) pivot! piv-ot! piv-et!! piv-ett!!! piv-et!", shut up! shut up! shut up!!
3402," all right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again."," okay, yeah, i think it's really stuck now."
3403," i know, me neither! i mean, you had a sketch!"," oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?"
3404," yeah, yeah, i met this woman. (starts for his room.)"," (stopping him) hey, whoa-whoa! what's she like?"
3405," closeness-shmoshness! there was three of us for crying out loud!  (entering) all right! hey, who wants pizza?!"," ooh, i do! i do! i do!"
3406," okay. and don't worry, i'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.", (to rachel) he has a gun!
3407," oh no, it is okay, i mean as long as you know that chandler and i are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! i mean our flame, whew, is on fire!"," (entering) hey monica, here's your broom back."
3408, you are so cute. (she goes over and kisses him passionately.)," oh hey, how'd the interview go?"
3409, did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?, so what happened?
3410," well, i didn't know what else to do!"," well you coulda tried, not kissing him."
3411," i accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause ""let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"""," come on, rach."
3412," no, in ross's building! (he throws rachel onto the chair and heads to the window.) she's back! she's back! (pantomimes) okay, wait there, i'll be over in a second. (he counts where she is again.) got it! (runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)"," i gotta check out this hot girl! (he heads to the window but realizes something, stops, turns and points at monica.) there she is! (he dances over to her and kisses her.)"
3413, oh. (realizes.) ohhhhhhhhh….," (to gary) so what do you say, maybe sometime i hold your gun?"
3414," i don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that."," oh, what can happen? i mean, would you… (he gestures and spills some of his coffee.)"
3415," oh umm, that's because i just wanted to y'know walk in on me and chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. will you excuse me for just a second?  okay. (she gets up and walks over to chandler.) chandler? can i see you for a second?"," uh, yeah."
3416," okay. (they walk away to get some privacy.) we have got to beat them! {here we go yet again.}  'cause, gary and phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!"," ohh, so?"
3417, so! so we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!," monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! okay? it's crazy. {finally! the voice of reason.} i mean, just impress gary and phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and i'm saying no to this, why? get your coat."
3418, i'll see you later. (starts to walk away.)  i forgot my paper. (ross quickly hides the card in his mouth.), that was amazing!
3419, phoebe and gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner., that was amazing.
3420, we are the hottest! huh? no one is hotter than we are! you're the best.," no, you're the best."
3421," you better believe he's tired, after the day we had! if you know what i mean. you know what i mean?"," honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean."
3422," so uh chandler, you like that badge i got you?","oh yeah, it's so cool. (he opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) now i gotta go, officer bing has gotta, 10-100. (pause, softly) that's pee-pee. (heads for the bathroom.)"
3423, i hear ya. excuse me for just a second! (gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)  hi chandler., monica! this is the men's room! (pause) isn't it?
3424, yes it is. you see i've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. haven't you?," no. and if i did, i don't think we'd be going out. monica, this is getting ridiculous!"
3425," come on, we can't let them win!"," ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! okay? so why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!"
3426, because phoebe and gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!, (gasps) so?
3427, i feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore., oh wow! is that what this all have been about?
3428, wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?," yeah that was great. that was really great! but to tell you the truth, i'm more excited about where we are right now.  yeah! i've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, i think that's pretty incredible. and the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah i think that's pretty exciting. (kisses her.)"
3429," that is so sweet. i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm, i feel the same way.  yeah. (they hug.)", y'know what i just realized? you just freaked out about our relationship.  yes you did! admit it! you freaked out!
3430," okay, i freaked out a little."," little?! you freaked out big time! okay? and i fixed it! we have switched places! i am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! (does a dance of joy.) (monica glares at him.) and now we're back."

3439, they're gonna do it together., dude! that's my girlfriend!
3440, it's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben's dad., weirder than watching his two moms make out? (monica nods in agreement.)
3441," i know! it's like i'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!"," yeah, it is the best."
3442," yeah, i can do that."," yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke."

3447," i just said that so you wouldn't let ben do it! look ross, if anyone should step aside it should be ben!  what? chandler! tell 'em!"," (shocked) well i mean, let me get the door first. (goes and opens the door.) oh, hi! no one. (exits.)"

3450," all right, fine! but i had too! i had to do it for my career!", i wish i had smoked for my career…
3451," no well, no it's not that bad, y'know? i mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, i actually feel like i can throw up."," okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!"
3452," chandler! i have to tell you, you smell so smokey i have to get up. i'm not kidding. (she's not; she stands and walks away. chandler moves closer.)", i think you smell great! (he sniffs her shoulder.)

3459," (to nancy) so we talked about the (chandler sneaks closer to her cigarette) whole presentation yesterday at lunch (closer) and he wondered if one person would be enough (closer) to get a take on the trip (still closer) and i said, ""yeah, absolutely!"" (she's interrupted by chandler who has reached his goal and takes a drag from her cancer stick.)", i'll catch you guys later. (exits.)

3481, chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!, thank you for that! (to monica) i was not flirting.
3482," it's no big deal, i do it all the time."," (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) so umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?"
3483, sure! it doesn't mean anything! just like i know it doesn't mean anything with you!," okay, but there is a big difference. you are a lot hotter than i am."
3484," chandler, this actually bothers you?"," yes, it does bother me! and i think it would bother a lot of people. rachel, when you were going out with ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?"
3485," okay, here's my big scene. my big scene's here! (they have two of the cops on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) oh my god.  (smiling) okay, everybody just keep smiling. it'll kill my grandmother if she finds out."," (smiling) well, what is it?"
3486," (smiling) joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? it's not your fault."," (smiling) if we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?"
3487," no, it's sam waterston! crimes and misdemeanors, capricorn one."," doesn't know, ""hello."" but she knows capricorn one."
3488, ohh! i did not get that.," so uh monica, do you, do you like the law & order?"
3489," yeah, it's good."," see, i'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the law & order and that you flirted with every guy in the tri-state area!"
3490," chandler! (joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.) okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me."," oh, i'm so glad we cleared that up. look, i'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women."
3491," go on, teach me something about men and women."," okay, i've already taught you so much already, but whatever. see when you flirt with a guy you think, ""i'm just flirting, no big deal."" but the guy is thinking, ""finally! somebody who wants to sleep with me!""  it's true."
3492, well that's pathetic!, again true.
3493, and this goes for all guys?, all guys that are awake. then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
3494, joey!," uh, joey is gonna be right back. right back! (tries to pantomime it for her.) meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (pause.) so, you're old and small."
3495," (running to the door) oh, mine! mine! mine! (to everyone) okay, here goes. prepare yourselves for some class a flirting."," okay, hold on. (pauses as he readies himself.) okay. (walks away.)"
3496, gas? wow! intense.," (to monica) if this is the way all the gellers flirt, we don't have a problem."
3497, a lot of other gas smells…, oh the humanity.
3498, (to all) was i talking to her about gas?, more so than anything else.
3499, (entering) hey! is the show still on?, almost over man.
3500, (says hi to his grandma) look! oh! (pointing out the window.) is that the pope?! (chandler and his grandma turn to look and joey slips a tape into the vcr.), why am i looking?
3501, that's right!, you couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
3502," joey, bravo! (starts with that italian stuff again.)", (singing) ground control to major tom! commencing countdown…engines…on!
3503," oh, then no.", (to monica) hey!  you ready?  you look amazing. i'm the luckiest man in the world.
3504," ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.", let me see the earrings.
3505," oh, honey, the earrings…", (looking at them) they look great! does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
3506, my boyfriend really does have good taste!, (to ross) thanks for picking out the earrings man.
3507," oh, yeah, good idea."," hey man, what's up?"
3508, okay!," yeah, yeah! me too!"
3509," really?! you?  well, it's kinda dangerous."," well, i like danger."
3510, yeah!!, tonight? you-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
3511," (to gary) that was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.", it is starting to get dark out there.
3512," yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.", (laughing) okay. (deadpan) but it is officially nighttime.
3513, (dejected) yeah okay. (to chandler) even though my tax dollars paid for this car., your tax dollars?
3514," yeah, okay.", (leans in and takes a sniff of joey's sandwich) wow! that sandwich really does smell good.
3515, did i say you could smell it?!, i can't smell your sandwich?
3516, half the taste is in the smell! you-you're sucking up all the tastiness!," okay, i'll give them back. (exhales strongly through his nose and joey just glares at him.) look! what is so great about that sandwich?"
3517, this witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.," sur-surprise him? we're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?"
3518," hey, i'm more cop than you two!", how do you figure that?
3519," hello! i'm in the front seat, okay? i'm gary's partner!"," y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. it, it sounds gay."
3520," sorry! sorry! oh, (he sticks it under his shirt) there! (it's just there flashing through his shirt) hey gary, who am i? phone home!", look at officer ross riding back here with the visitors.
3521, noooooooo!," okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? i mean nothing bad can go down!"
3522," oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off."," (deadpan) oh, hurry up. i want to sign that."
3523, uh-huh. thank joey!," uh, hello!!"
3524," my god, joey!", (pouting) it was a car backfire!
3525," hey joe, you ever think about joining the force? we could use a guy like you.", who jumps at loud noises!
3526, wow! i could've died tonight.," yeah! if the car that backfired had run over you! y'know what, i think i'll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (he gets up and starts for the door.)"
3527, i do have a newfound respect for life., (returning) oh my god! (storms out.)
3528, cut it out ross! i hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!  dude! how come you took off?," oh, i just went for a walk, around the living room. whatever…"
3529, is something wrong?," no. no i'm just tired. y'know, from-from the walk.  you dove in front of ross! ross!"
3530," that's what this is about! oh my god, you hate ross!", i do not hate ross!
3531, of course you do! i saved him! you're mad at me! it all adds up! you want ross out of the picture., what picture?
3532," i don't know, but i don't like what i'm hearing!"," look i'm very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!"
3533," ohh, you're upset because you think i chose ross over you! no! i…knew…you could take care of yourself. y'know, i mean ross, he need help. he's not street like us!"," when it comes down to it, you would risk your life for ross before you would for me. that's the bottom line."
3534," well, no, not exactly! all right, look, i, i wasn't trying to save ross. okay? my sandwich was next to ross. all right? i was, i was trying to save my sandwich.", from a bullet!
3535, i know it doesn't make much sense…, much sense?!
3536," look chandler, it was instinct! okay? i just went for it!"," so you risked your life, for a sandwich!"
3537," i know it sounds crazy, but chandler this is (goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!"," so you didn't uh, choose ross before me."
3538," no! i would never do that! you-you're like my brother!  yeah! in fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (he unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for chandler) here.", thanks. (he grabs the sandwich.)
3539," no, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!  how good is that?"," (with his mouthful) oh-oi-ho, yeah!"
3540, see?, hm-hmm. (goes to take another bite.)
3541," oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!", i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
3542," man, i would be great in a war! i mean, i really, i think i would make a fantastic military leader. i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys.", before or after you were shot by your own troops?
3543, i know where joey would be. he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.," yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches."
3544," i'm fine, thanks."," (to monica) yeah, see, i can't pull of baby-doll can i?"
3545, no. i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. i'm gonna get some tea., hiya doin' pumpkin?
3546, i can't believe this!," (terrified) right, because it's fast. because, it's so fast. it's fast!"
3547, relax! it's phoebe! not you!," oh! good for you pheebs, way to go! (breathes a sigh of relief)"
3548," no, i like him a lot but i don't think i'm ready for this!"," so, what are you gonna do?"
3549, i don't know. i'll just handle it—i'll ask you to talk to him!, me?! why me?
3550," because you are so afraid of commitment! you talk to him, make him scared like you! make him a…man!"," i'll try, but i'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? because i'm a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be."
3551, that is so sweet! (she kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her tea.)," (to phoebe, behind monica's back) still terrified, i'll take care of it. no problem. (when monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to phoebe.)"
3552," i know! (looks at the ball in his hands.) don't switch hands, okay?", hey ladies! what are you in here for? (laughs at his joke.)
3553," hey chandler, what are you doing here?"," gary, i'm here to report a crime."
3554, yeah?, it is a crime that you and i don't spend more time together.
3555," (laughs, then suddenly serious) what's up?"," well, i heard that you thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you and i thought maybe, we should have a talk. man to uh, me."
3556, sure. okay.," uh, are you crazy? are you insane? if you live with phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!"
3557," yeah, i-i considered that. i just know it would make me happy.", you mean scared.
3558," no, i mean happy.", scared? happy?
3559," chandler, what-what are you doing?"," i am trying to open your eyes, my man! don't you see, if you lived with phoebe she's always gonna be there. you're gonna get home, she's there. you go to bed, she's there. you wake up and oh yes, she's there!"
3560, i know! i can't wait!," were you're parents happy, or something?"
3561," listen chandler, the way i see it is that i was lucky enough to find someone that i really love. i just—i wanna be around her as much as i can."," wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary."
3562," so you know what i'm talking about, right?"," yeah, i think i do! y'know what? you move in with her! you move in with her right now! maybe i should in with monica!"
3563," no, it's too soon for you guys."," (pause) yeah, you're right about that."
3564," hmm, did you talk to gary about the moving in thing?"," yes i did, and i think you should do it.  he's a great guy, y'know? and he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady."
3565, you are useless! freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! the one thing! and you can't even do that right! god!," i’m sorry. (pause) if you ask me, i'd move in with him."
3566, hey chandler., hey gar!
3567, (catching the ball) monica! stop throwing it so hard! we're on the same team!, four hours? you guys have been doing this for four hours?
3568, that's right baby.," all right, let me in. (he jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)"
3569," oh yeah, that's right!", i'm not a dropper!
3570," it's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?", it's throwing and catching!
3571, all right. (he gently tosses the ball to chandler who catches it.)," oh! oh! that's so hard. (starts to juggle the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to monica.)"
3572, i tried! they won't take her back., maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-christ.
3573," oh my god, the cat's made my eyes water! don't-don't throw it to me! my vision's been compromised!! (quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) oh god! okay. okay. it's okay. man, that was close."," yeah, you almost overreacted to something."
3574, please! i made this game what it is., not fun anymore?
3575," oh yeah, that's over."," come on! gary's such a great guy! whatever the problem is, you can work it out!"
3576, he shot a bird!, oh that is over!
3577," okay! okay, let's race! first one there wins! ha-ha! (runs out the door and everyone watches her leave.)", you guys wanna eat here?
3578," no, i meant with the dropper over here. (points at chandler.)"," y'know, how did i get this reputation as a dropper? okay? i'm anything but a dropper. (we see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. i'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)"
3579, richard? i'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!," oh, richard. that's all i ever hear, richard, richard, richard!"
3580," since we've been going out, i think i've mentioned his name twice!"," okay, so richard, richard!"
3581, (freaks) ross! stop it! come on!," how much did i love the king and i? (oh, you get the point by now.)"
3582, just stop it! come on!, you okay there man?
3583, (after he's gone) i am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. i didn't mean to be so out there. i am furious with him!," wow umm, calm down."
3584, you wanna be on my list too? keep talking! has anyone seem my list by the way?," uh, no pheebs. what's it look like?"
3585," (entering, depressed) hey. i just got off the phone with estelle and guess what. (pause, then very excitedly) i got the lead in a movie!!!!!!", you got the lead in a movie? that's amazing! what's the movie about?!
3586," and the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside vegas! (to chandler) and you know what that means buddy!"," yeah, i know that means buddy!"
3587," oh wait, my grandmother's dead."," well, uh, we can talk about that too pheebs."
3588, all right! thanks pheebs!," whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?"
3589," oh umm, not go."," all right, great, road trip baby! (to monica) this okay with you?"
3590, chandler! you don't have to ask for my permission. (quietly) you can go., thank you.
3591, hey! you ready to go?,"yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? do i need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (holds up 3 of them in different colors.)"
3592, thanks a lot! i just got that jerk out of my mind!," hey, so where are we staying? is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?"
3593," uh no, not really. it's an independent film y'know? so we don't have a real big budget. i figured i'd just stay in your room."," i see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? i mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?"
3594," oh yeah! for every dollar shutter speed makes, one penny of it goes right in joey's pocket.", so you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
3595, all right!," all right, bye-bye now!"
3596," man, i'm getting pretty tired. you're might have to take over soon."," we've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once."
3597," don't worry, it's out there! (just then a horn honks and joey quickly looks at the road.) i think i just need lunch.  you wanna eat? (pulls out the twenty) my treat!", isn't that ross's money?
3598, yeah. okay. ross's treat! where do you wanna eat?, i don't know.
3599," ooh, hey, i know how we can decide! all right, uh, i'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. okay? so uh, clear your mind clear it right out! clear it out! clear!  okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?", too dry.
3600," do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?  is this movie gonna be my big break?  (shocked) what?!  dude you said, ""no!"""," i also said, ""yes!"""
3601, you don't think this is going to be a big break for me?, no! (realizes) ahhh!!!
3602, i don't believe this!," look joe, i just, i just don't want to get your hopes up real high."
3603, what are you talking about?! i'm the lead in a movie!, they're not even paying ya! this doesn't even sound like a real movie!
3604, y'know what? i don't need this! okay? i don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.," joe, i don't think this is going to be your big break."
3605," is that why you're on this trip, huh? make me feel like a loser? 'cause if it is, i'll tell ya, i-i-i'd rather be alone."," oh, you don't want me on the trip?"
3606, not if you're gonna be like this!," all right, i'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that i'll lie."
3607, yeah! i don't want you on the trip!," all right, fine! fine! why don't you pull over? i'll get out right now!"
3608," fine! (he slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound of numerous car horns.) get out!", you're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
3609, get out!!," all right!! (gets out and joey speeds away.) wait! wait, there's no sidewalk! yeah, i'm gonna die here."
3610, chandler! what are you doing here?, joey kicked me out of the car on the george washington bridge!
3611, why?!," i don't know! he went crazy! y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast."
3612, that game should not be played without my supervision.," well, i don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? all i said was that uh, i didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge."
3613, what's in the bag?," oh, i figured you guys would all be mad at me. so i got you some gifts that i found on the side of the road. (looks into the bag.) who wants the teddy bear with one leg?"
3614, oh that's my grandma. (joey holds the box away from him.) and thanks joey she's having a really great time. (joey is happy now.), (who has just entered) is that joey? is that joey? let me talk to him! i wanna talk to him!
3615," okay joey? chandler's here, he was wondering… (we hear the dial tone as joey hangs up.) okay, i guess he ran out of change."," y'know, he won't even talk to me. how am i going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?"
3616," well, maybe you should send him something. so that when he gets to las vegas he'll know that you're sorry.", that's a good idea. i wonder where i could (pause) get a basket of porn…
3617," (to joey) ooh, do you want to talk to chandler?", (to phoebe) is that joey?! (she nods yes) let me talk to him!
3618," uhh, my stunt double. yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes."," (to phoebe) y'know what? i have been trying to apologize to him all week! if he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, i'm gonna go down there and do it in person."
3619, yeah! (she hands the phone to chandler.), (to joey) hey!
3620, don't come out here!," no-no-no-no, i've supported you one hundred percent and i want to prove that to you in person!"
3621, i got that! i forgive ya! don't come out here!, forgive me? you haven't been taking my calls in a week!
3622, (to joey) would you mind doing a picture with us?," uh, what was that?"
3623, it's almost our anniversary!, i know. can you believe it? one year ago today i was just your annoying friend chandler.
3624, i got you a present!," oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!"
3625," i know, but you have to open it today! (hands it too him.)  (grabbing the gift from him and opening it) okay! there you go! it's two tickets to vegas!  for this weekend! oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. we can call it out plane-aversary."," do we have to?  okay this is great, but joey said he didn't want any of us out there."
3626," oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! plus we get to have our own, ani-vegas-ary! a-nevadaversary!"," yeah, i think we should see other people."
3627," but we can go, right?", it's a great idea. (they kiss)
3628," okay, i'm gonna go too!"," y'know pheebs, it's kinda our (his and monica's) anniversary."
3629," oh, but i've got tickets to the van gogh exhibit! i've been waiting like a year for this.", (coughing) art lover!
3630, what'd you say?, i said art lover.
3631, is that supposed to be an insult?," i don't know, i'm very tired."
3632," uh-huh! why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?  so, so far is this trip to vegas better or worse than the trip to london?", so it's pretty much the same pheebs.
3633," okay, what about after i give you these candies? (hands them each one from her purse.)"," yeah, i guess it's a little better now."
3634,"ah-ha! okay, (takes out a notepad) las vegas 1, london 0! i'll be right back. (gets up and heads aft.)", (to monica) happy plane-aversary.
3635, aww! i love you!, can i give you a present now?  okay! (he grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) oh man! don’t tell me i did this!
3636," i love the ""i forgot the present"" fake out!"," how do you feel about the, ""i really did forgot the present, please forgive me"" not fake out?"
3637," oh that's okay. don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.", ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
3638," (sitting down) oh good! all right, so you decided to tell him about the richard thing.", what-what richard thing?
3639, oh no. [the patented version.], what richard thing?
3640," okay, i umm, i ran into richard yesterday and he asked me if i wanted to go for a bite and i did. the only reason i didn't tell you is because i knew you'd get mad and i didn't want to spoil our anniversary."," (talking out of the side of his mouth) i'm not mad.  oh yeah! yeah, so you-you bumped into richard! you grabbed a bite! it's no big deal. (he still ain't happy.)"
3641,"for 99 cents, i'd eat you. (sees the casino) okay, i can totally settle down here. it's got everything i could ever want, including joey! look! (points to joey in his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) oh! look! hi!  hey! joey! (they all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.) hey! hey!! wow! (she hugs him.)", love your condoms my man.
3642," they uh director. uhh, her. (points to an old woman standing behind him. who glares at him and walks off.) all right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. i work here.", why?! what happened?!
3643," look, i'm sorry i didn't tell ya. (to chandler) i'm sorry man."," no-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody."
3644, noo! but that would've been so cool!, no! her boyfriend richard!
3645," it meant nothing! okay? after all this time, how can you not trust me?", when you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
3646, you're right. i'm sorry. i should've told you., thanks. (they hug.)
3647," i promise you, next time i will absolutely tell you.", (pushing her away from another hug) next time?
3648," ooh, so close.", there's not gonna be a next time! you can not ever see him again!
3649," i can not see him? i mean, you can't tell me what to do!"," that's so funny, because i think i just did!"
3650," oh y'know what? if you're gonna be acting like this all night, i really, i don't even want to be around you.", fine with me!
3651, no it is not!, what are you talking…
3652," hey, y'know in roman times this was more than just a hat.  yeah, sure! sure! they would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! they would use it to get the mud off their shoe. and sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right…"," (interrupting in the nick of time) joey, i uh! i can't believe this is how i'm spending my anniversary."
3653," all right well, i'll take you someplace nice then. look! a guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.", whoa!
3654,"yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. can you believe that? $5,000!","y'know, if i won $5,000 i'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit richard from behind with a stick! (mimics it.)"
3655,"wait a minute! why don't i do what that guy did? i'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! and then i'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!", good luck!
3656, chandler! i don't need luck. i have thought this through!, i see.
3657," hit me! (he does so.) ohh man! (joey busts and loses all the money, but when the dealer starts to collect the cards joey notices something.) wait! (he holds his hand next to the dealer's hand.)  chandler! you are not gonna believe this! i have found my identical hand twin!", (totally confused) what?
3658, my identical hand twin!, what's an identical hand twin?
3659," what's it sound like? it's a guy with my identical hands! it was incredible! chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! it-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!", are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?
3660, don’t you see what this means?! i can forget about that stupid movie. i'm gonna be a millionaire!, (totally confused) how?
3661," look, i don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! come on! identical hands!"," again i must go back to, how?"
3662," this is vegas man! people will pay to see freaky stuff! okay, how much would you pay to see this hand (holds up his left hand) twice? huh?"," (pause) y'know, i-i can't really put a price on that joe."
3663," hey, are you unsupporting me again?","no! no! i support you 100%! i just didn't, i didn't get it right away. y'know now i'm caught up! identical hand twins! it's a million-dollar idea!"
3664," ohh, you are so lucky! (to chandler) hey! so, where's monica? did you guys make up?  but she just came up here!", that was joey!
3665, i wonder where she is. that is so weird.," yeah, well, she's probably talking to richard."
3666," would you stop that! do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with richard? she didn't feel anything for him. she loves you!  yes! now, she feels terrible! she really wants to make up! you gotta find her.", okay. (he gets up and goes to find her.)
3667," all right baby, come on! (rolls the dice) yes! yes! i am on fire!", (walking by with his luggage) see you later mon.
3668," wait chandler, what are you doing?!", what does it look like? i'm going home.
3669," what? wait! why? (he turns and heads for the door and she chases after him.) chandler! chandler! wait! i’m sorry, i was just playing for one second! i was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see richard again, i won't! he means nothing to me!", come on! i was there! (he's propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. he winces and pulls his hand away.) i know he's the love of your life.
3670," not any more.  really! (they hug and kiss) all right? let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (she picks up his suitcase.) okay, this is empty."," yeah, i wanted to make a dramatic scene, but i hate packing."
3671, (seeing her) get out of here you lurker! (she doesn't move) go on! get! (she throws a quarter at her.), (arm-in-arm with monica) hey pheebs!
3672," yeah, i couldn't be mad at him for too long."," yeah, she couldn't live without the chan love. (they start kissing.)"
3673, (shaking the dice) a new pair of shoes for the chan-chan man! (rolls the dice.) yes!, yes! i've-i've never seen a roll like this in my life!
3674," that's right baby! okay, what do i want now?","okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. ah, a 6?"

3676," (to chandler) we're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?  okay, good! okay, what do i want now?","ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.  two fours."
3677, (to chandler) don't you let her go! you're a lucky guy!," thank you, mister drunken gambler! okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! (everyone cheers) wait-wait-wait-wait! we (motions to monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place."
3678," all right, biggest suite in the place. come on! (rolls the dice.)", (sees the roll) yes!! i love you! i can't even remember what we were fighting about!
3679," oh, that's because i had lunch with rich—me neither! okay, what do i want now?",another hard 8.
3680,hard 8?! we should call it easy 8!," okay, okay, i tell you what. you roll another hard eight; (pause) and we get married here tonight."
3681, shut up!! it just got interesting!  what did you just say?, you roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
3682, are you serious?!, yes! i love you! i've never loved anybody as much as i love you.
3683, i've never loved anybody as much as i love you.," okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {whoa! where have i heard that before? matthew perry talking about signs in las vegas. i guess it must've been some movie i saw.} what do you say?  okay! come on! let's go! all right!  (spots one) okay! that's a four! and where-where's the other one?"
3684," nobody move! (to chandler) okay, you look that way; i'll look this way!", here it is! here it is!
3685, that could be a four or a five. it's your call., it's a four.
3686," okay, come on, i can't get married until i get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."," okay, all right, all right, all right! okay! (picks up a blue sweater.) okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
3687, you're so efficient. i love you!, let's go! (starts to leave.)
3688, no-no-no! we need something old!," ohh, great, i have condom in my wallet i've had since i was twelve."
3689, that'll work!, i don't think so.
3690," okay, now we just need something borrowed!", (looks around) here just…take this. (hands her the sweater.)
3691, that's stealing!," no, we'll-we'll bring it back! just put it under your dress."
3692, ohh. (rubs her fake stomach.)," okay, one thing at a time. (they run out to get married.)"
3693," me?! oh come on, man! you can't do this! come on! (being dragged out by the guard) i'm your hand twin!!", hello! one marriage please!
3694," no, only because that's the graduation song.", okay! (stands up) this is it! (claps his hands) we're gonna get married!
3695, okay! okay! okay! (they run into the chapel.), oh my god!! is everybody getting married?!!
3696, ross and rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! isn’t that why you guys are here?, yes! well that-yes.
3697, well! what happened?! did we miss it?, we actually missed it.
3698," all right. although i don’t think we need one, i never stopped loving you."," so, has anyone talked to dr. and mrs. geller yet?"
3699, where is the waitress?! i’m starving!, it’s a buffet man.
3700," oh, here’s where i win all my money back! (gets up and heads for the buffet table with chandler in tow.)"," listen, i gotta talk to you."
3701, sure! what’s up? (he grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a huge pile of scrambled eggs. chandler just stares at him and joey reluctantly gives him a spoonful.), monica and i almost got married last night.
3702," oh my god! that’s huge! (hugs him.) wait a minute, why come i wasn’t invited? and who was going to be your best man? don’t say, ""ross."" do not say, ""ross."""," look, i just don’t think monica and i are ready to get married yet! y’know? i mean, i love her and everything but seeing ross and rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that monica and i are moving so fast. y’know? and, how do i tell her without crushing her?"
3703, good! good! i was just testing you., (returning with joey) hi.
3704, (gasps) who got married?! (ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.), (not quite sure) you did.
3705," well, i guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (looks at ross.)"," well, i think, i think, ross already has one. now, this one’s free, right? because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free."
3706," so, what do you think we should do?", i don’t know. but i-i-i know i love you!
3707, i know i love you! (they hug.), so where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? i love you.
3708," that’s a good question. look umm, last night we let the dice decide. maybe we should leave it up to fate again. i love you!"," yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a definite sign that we should get married."
3709,"all right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.", sounds great.
3710, (sarcastic) come on eight.," (deadpan) yes, yes eight."
3711, wow! i can’t believe i actually rolled an eight.," that was so unlikely. well, let’s get married! i guess."
3712, wait a minute. that wasn’t a hard eight! last night i rolled a hard eight.," that’s right! it was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! damnit!"
3713, i wanted it so bad! (pause) wanna go pack?," yeah. (they go pack.) we’re doing the right thing, right?"
3714, that kid really kicked me hard on the plane., well you did pull his hair.
3715, he took my snack!, i’m not getting into this again!
3716," okay! oh god, y’know what? it’s really bad.","  well, i told you not to walk. here. (picks her up.) there. okay. (he opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of monica who is only holding on by his neck.)"
3717," all right. okay chandler, enjoy your handful. (exits.)"," all right, should we just, should we just get married? y’know? i mean should we just do it? all the signs are telling us to do it."
3718," i’m sick of the signs! it’s too fast, i’m happy the way things are!", me too!
3719," i don’t want things to change! do you?  all right then, then nothing changes! everything is great! everything stays the same! and you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving me insane!"," jeez, relax! it’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! (runs out.)  (entering, slowly) y’know i was thinking, what if i uh, unpack here?"
3720, then all your stuff would be here.," well, what if all my stuff was here?"
3721," then you’d be going back and forth all the time, i mean it doesn’t make any sense.", okay. what if we lived together and you understand what i’m saying?
3722, live together? there have been no signs for that., me asking is kind of a sign.
3723, yes!!!!!!!!, okay!!!!!
3724, yes! okay! okay! wait-wait-wait!  here’s your key (gets him one.), oh thanks.
3725," here’s your key. all right, you have to christen it! now, go out and come back in!"," the door hasn’t been locked in five years, but okay! (runs out.) ready?!"
3726, ready!," okay, a little problem. the key broke in the lock and i can’t get in!"
3727, wait! oh my god! i can’t get out!, this is not a sign!
3728," no, it’s not a sign! it’s a very old key!", it’s an old key!
3729, oh my god it’s old!, i love you!
3730, i love you!," are you hugging the door right now.  yeah-yeah, me neither."
3731, i didn’t get the annulment.  we’re still married! don’t tell rachel. see you later. (he gets up leaving phoebe in shock.), the key’s stuck in the lock.
3732, i can fix it. hold on. (he goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment) look out. look out. (pries at the door a little bit.), (trying the handle) it still doesn’t work.
3733, i’m not finished., nice job joe! you’re quite the craftsmen.
3734," in case you’re wondering, and i know you are. their names are all back to normal. just in a slightly smaller font than usual to allow courteney cox arquette to fit on one line and not be smaller than the rest of their names. now, on with the show…}"," y’know when we move in together, can i get a gumball machine?"
3735, of course! joey wouldn’t let you have one?," no. when it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict."
3736," hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?"," no, no, i keep trying, y’know? i can get out, ""joey, i have too…"" but then i lose my nerve and i always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom."" he may think i’m sick."
3737," y’know, i really have to tell rachel, but i… we just have to get it over with! y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. okay? that’s it."," oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? you’re just gonna order me around all the time?"
3738, oh my god! you’re pregnant!," no-o-o! (to monica) no? (she nods no.) no-o-o! look joey, here’s the thing, monica and i have decided to live together, here. so, i’m gonna be moving out man."
3739," yeah, i gotta go! i got an acting job. (turns towards the door, pauses, and turns back.) like you’d believe that. this sucks!"," look, i-i’m just gonna be right across the hall and i promise you, the minute monica and i break up i’m moving right back in with you!"
3740," ugh, i thought you were rachel!", (looking down) what gave me away?
3741," i just tell her, i have to get it over with. i told ross and phoebe and she’s the only one left!"," okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! it’s official, we’re moving in together. no turning back. are ya scared? are ya?  wow that was my scariest voice! you’re very brave."
3742," ugh, the worse day! y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you raquel."," hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me sha-la-lap. (awkward silence ensues.) seriously."
3743," i believe you. so, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me raquel! by the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me rocky!"," well, i-i still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…  (to monica) all yours babe. (walks away.)"
3744," and chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know raquel can’t be late.", rach…
3745, i am so attracted to him right now.," okay, when are we gonna tell rachel what is actually gonna happen?"
3746," soon! i-i just couldn’t before. you saw how upset joey got! i couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!"," well, joey’s my best friend."
3747, i’m not your best friend?, you just said… of course you’re my best friend. would you please tell rachel though?
3748," all right, all right, at least i’m prepared.", okay. (she grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) oh yes. (he reaches for one.)
3749, (slapping his hand) hey!, hey-hey!
3750, these aren’t for you! are you upset?, i am now!
3751, (entering) hey roomie!," okay, bye! (exits.)"
3752," god, it’s gonna so weird like when i come home and you’re not here. y’know? no more joey and chan’s. no more j and c’s. ""you wanna go over to joey and chandler’s?"" ""can’t, its not there."""," look, i’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff."
3753, yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future., not once did we do that.
3754," so i, i told rachel it was just gonna be the two of us."," oh yeah? well, how’d she take it?"
3755," really well. yeah. surprisingly well. yeah, she didn’t cry. she wasn’t angry or sad. (sits down, slightly disgusted.)", and you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?
3756, hey! i did not cry my eyes out!! come on! it’s like the end of an era! no more j-man and channie’s!!," okay, i gotta ask, who calls us that?!"
3757," hey, what is with the secrecy phoebe? huh? and what about this denise, is she cute?"," pheebs, i don’t understand. how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?"
3758," yeah, yeah i think i’m gonna find my own place.", hey-hey! i thought naked thursday’s was just our thing man!
3759," hey! (to chandler) dude, some guy just called for you.", who was it?
3760," okay listen, y’know when you move in rachel’s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?", sure!
3761," okay, i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! okay, whatever, i really haven’t thought about it that much.","well, i like that idea. obviously! i was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like space invaders and asteroids for $200, the real ones! the big-big ones!  okay so you mean no as in, ""gee chandler, what an interesting idea. let’s discuss it before we reject it completely."""
3762," oh, i’m sorry. of course i mean that. interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no."," so, that’s it?"
3763, i just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques., which is why asteroids is perfect! it’s the oldest game!
3764, what do you have against the beautiful guest room?,"i don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
3765, are you mocking me?," no, i’m not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (exits.)"
3766," hey, what’s up?"," nothing, monica and i had a stupid fight."
3767," but you’re still moving in together, right? because my ad came out today. (shows him the paper.)"," (reading the ad) ""wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" nice!"
3768," no. no, i won’t. but i should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise. she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! and that’s how she ended up living with me! (ross looks at her.) (pause) okay, that’s a lie."," hi, listen, i’m sorry about before. i don’t need to have a game room. i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldn’t get girls, and now i can ‘em—now, i have you. (monica glares at him.) not-not that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, i see women…"
3769," stop it chandler. (chandler is relieved) i’m sorry too.  yeah! oh yes!  listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.", that’s a great idea! we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
3770, totally!, so it did go well.
3771, oh good.," hey, y’know what? why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?"
3772, changes?," yeah, i mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (kisses her and heads into the living room.)"
3773, you’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the barca lounger over here?, is that a problem?
3774," well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together."," oh, that’s cool. then i’ll just bring them both over."
3775, see now-now you’re taking them away from their home.," okay, i get it. so, i get nothing! nothing here is mine! everything here is yours! i’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!"
3776," yeah-yeah, y’know what? yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! nothing will be yours! that’s-that’s what i said! oh come on, chandler! i’m talking about the barca lounger! it just, it doesn’t match! where is it gonna go?!", in the game room!
3777, look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!, all right! that’s fine! that’s fine! i won’t bring over the chairs! i won’t bring anything over! i wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma’s place!! (storms out.)
3778," whoa!! now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. i want you to really think about your answers. okay?", (entering) you can call off the roommate search! (to the potential roommate) hi! i’ll be living here. (heads for the bathroom.)
3779," oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but i don’t think he’s gonna get it.", why did you take the shower curtain down?
3780," well, apparently not, and i can’t just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. i mean, enough of the silliness!"," well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! (monica mocks him and he joins in.)"
3781," (stopping them) okay-okay! two very good points, look i’ve known you both a long time, and i’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. do you really want to throw that all away over a room? that is so silly. now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?"," well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love."
3782, love is the best medicine., that’s laughter.
3783," okay! all right! now, chandler you-you wanna live with monica, right?"," yeah, i do."
3784, that’s very funny!," he’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!"
3785," okay, there are no stupid fights!! this isn’t about the room, this is about what the room…represents! and unfortunately, this room (points to rachel’s room) could destroy you!!"," yeah, i'm not so worried."
3786, you still want to move in together right?, of course!
3787, ross didn’t scare you?, scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
3788," come here, i want to show you something!", oh my god! someone’s killed square man!
3789, this is where i thought the barca lounger could go! you see you could see the tv and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.," oh that’s so sweet! i want to show you something too!  y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""merge?"""
3790, uh-hmm.," y’know? so i was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. because, that’s you and i together! merge!"
3791, (to ross) saved your ass.," oh, what’s the matter?"
3792, i don’t—she said y’know that i’d have triplets! but she also said one of them would be black., just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?
3793, (entering) hey everyone!, oh hi!
3794," ohh! okay! okay. (resumes reading word for word from the card) ""there are three (pauses and looks at joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. (pauses and darts his eyes between chandler and rachel.) (rachel starts laughing) each of these theories (glances at phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at chandler) into…""", why don’t you open with a joke?
3795," open with a joke? it’s a university, not a comedy club!"," wait a minute, hold the phone! you’re not talking about chuckles university?!"
3796, i-i-i don’t even know why i bother to talk to you guys about it. y’know what? i’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.,that’s the way i did it ‘til i was 19.
3797, hey! any good mail?," yes, you got something from the screen actor’s guild."
3798," ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, i’m kinda…."," (opens and reads it) ""benefits lapsed."""
3799, hmm that’s weird. i don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.," okay, it’s not a check. they’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year."
3800," let me see that!  (reads it) oh, i can’t believe this! this sucks! when i had insurance i could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? and it wouldn’t matter. now i gotta be careful?!"," i’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire."
3801," all right well, i guess i gotta go get a job. i’m gonna go see my agent."," okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
3802, bastard!  (in obvious pain) hey! so estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and i’ll have my health insurance back in no time.," that’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?  what’s wrong with you?"
3803," nothing! well, i-i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before, then i uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. but um, i don’t think it’s anything serious.", this sounds like a hernia. you have to—you-you go to the doctor!
3804," no way! ‘kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (rolls over and shows chandler.)", that’s a hernia.
3805," (in an indian accent) yes, yes, bombay is bery, bery nice time of year."," hey, will you grab me a cruller? (joey starts to groan and get up.) sit down! will you go to the hospital?!"
3806," dude! hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.", i will loan you the money. just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.
3807," eh, better her than me! hey, let’s bake cookies!"," listen, i’m really glad you got the part."
3808, (barely audible through the pain) thank you., but are you sure you can do this?
3809," yeah! and hey, thanks for coming with me. and thanks again for helping me take a shower."," now, is that never talking about it again?!"
3810, cut!!!!!!!!!! (joey starts screaming again.)," i’m sorry! hey-hey joe, why don’t you uh, lift up your shirt? (he does.) take a look at this kiddo. (alex finally starts crying.) we have a crying child! roll the damn cameras!"
3811, we’re just celebrating that joey got his health insurance back.," oh, all right."
3812," okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. but i just couldn’t face another failed marriage."," okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?"
3813, another lie. you have a sickness!," ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to anymore of us are ya?"
3814, there’s a lost and found? (gunther sets the box up on the table.) my shoe! (grabs it out of the box.), you left a shoe here?!
3815," well, i didn’t realize until i got home. i wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! y’know what? i’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield. (goes to do so.)"," oh good, when he comes back for his keys, i’ll be sure to give him your shoe."
3816," oh my god, what a fun day! that sounds great!"," (not enthused) yeah, all right."
3817," okay, well i’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. okay, and uh, by the way, they’re not actually puppies, they’re frank and alice’s triplets. okay, see ya! (exits.)", whoa-whoa-whoa! what?
3818," don’t worry about it phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it."," yeah, i’m gonna pass. ‘cause i was kinda iffy when it was puppies."
3819," nope, sound like me. pheebs, it’s going great. look at chandler with little baby girl chandler."," little baby girl chandler, where i have heard that before? oh right, coach ruben. (tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. it’s times like these i’m glad smell-o-vision hasn’t been invented.) do you know what pheebs? when you’re done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. (phoebe is changing hers.)"
3820," na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies."," see that’s where i think that you’re wrong. we’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.  i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. and y’know mon, you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around… (he degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his finger.)"
3821," that sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping."," okay, i’m a rookie. i should not be in the end zone."
3822," hey babies! oh, i’m having the best morning. that uh, that porsche i’ve got the keys too, still there!", shocking! since you still have the keys.
3823," you should see the treatment i get when i’m with that car! people are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! one guy gave me advice about my equity investments.", what equity investments?
3824," oh yeah, i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound.", you don’t even have a car!
3825," i know. but umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so i washed it.", and?
3826, and six others., there you are.
3827," yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same."," (entering) check it out! check it out! when the babies wake up, they can meet krog! (he holds up this xena-like warrior action figure.)"
3828," chandler, what are you doing? that thing can put someone’s eye out!", he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe!
3829," no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! and also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up."," they’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!  glass, sand, whatever. (walks out as monica and phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)"
3830, how are you still single?!, (entering) all right. (clears throat) i thought about it and maybe you’re right. maybe krog is not a safe toy.
3831, good. what made you change your mind?, i swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
3832, how did that happen?!!," well, i was trying to prove that i was right. y’know? and it turns out i was wrong. and now it’s lodged in my throat. (mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.) (he does it again.)"
3833, (entering wearing nothing but porsche clothes) so the porsche guy took his car back., but you found the keys to his clothes?
3834, of course! only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! right?, that is true.
3835, come on! what are you doing?! i’m in character! would you talk to her! (storms out.)," ahh, i think it just moved. it’s really poking me."
3836," but no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.", i think that’s gum.
3837, i’m pretty sure it’s gun.," okay, listen this really hurts. let’s go."
3838," me taking care of you is no problem, huh? you guys feel safe. right? okay, i’m gonna take that spit bubble as, ""yeah, i do!"" okay, after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie, i’ll set you up with a clean one. (she throws it at the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the floor and break.) okay, i’m sorry. i didn’t mean to scare you. i just have to clean that up. okay? ‘cause let’s face it, we’re at monica’s. (she crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) i broke it. all right. well, that’s just the way that goes. (she throws out both the flowers and the vase.) okay, good. (she turns around and only counts two babies.) why are there only two of you? where is leslie? well, you can’t answer. (she starts looking for her) leslie? where are you leslie? leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (she turns around and finds that leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the tv cabinet.) well, look at you! hey! you are a little bit mischievous! my gosh! (she picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) oh, you’re a lot mischievous! well, it’ll dry. (closes the drawer with her foot.) (to leslie) okay, you sit with your brother and sister now—who aren’t there! (they both have disappeared as well.)  (exhausted) how do you feel?"," well, let’s just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
3839," okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself! i fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.", and protected them from a tornado?
3840, but my apartment!, was the setting of phoebe’s triumph.
3841, but the mess!, is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
3842," you’re right, you’re right i shouldn’t freak out. ‘cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies! when will that be?!"," (pause) phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!"
3843," i’d love to show ya, but i just tucked her in. she’s sleeping. (the women both laugh) hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. it turns out that joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a porsche.)"," (watches joey for a moment) okay! (joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that he’s scratching his back with it.) listen, i’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent."
3844, right! and when is that due?, first of the month.
3845, and that’s every month?," no, just the months you actually want to live here."
3846, ahhh.," okay, here is the phone bill. (hands it to joey.)"
3847, (looking at it) oh my god!!," that’s our phone number. now look, i know i kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t i just—why don’t i just cover you for a while?"
3848, no-no! no way! joey tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.," it’s not charity, joe…"
3849," no! forget it! okay—i mean thanks, but i’m done taking money from you. all right, i can take of myself. now, what’s next? come on."," okay uh, here’s the electric bill. (hands it to him.)"
3850, this is how much we pay for electric?!!!," so, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?"
3851, so is joey going to have to give up the apartment?," no, i hope not! i tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it."
3852," well, how much do you think he needs?","i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? but i have to trick him into taking it so i won’t hurt his pride."
3853, why don’t you hire him as an actor? you could have him dress up and put on little skits. whatever you want., well that would help the pride thing.
3854, (entering from her room) hey!, hey! wow! you look great! wanna move in with me tomorrow?
3855, (thinks) okay.," okay! (they kiss) so, what do you girls have planned for tonight?"
3856, what a mean thing to say! i would never tell you it’s not your birthday!  hey! so you guys have anything planned for the big last night?," well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing."
3857,"(entering and interrupting the guy’s escape attempt) okay! the movers will be here in 11 hours. rachel has not packed. now, everybody has to help! chandler, we’re gonna start with…"," oh nope, i-i have plans with joey."
3858, i thought you said you were going to do nothing.," yes, but for the last time."
3859,"it’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. where-where is he?", he’s at a dinner party.
3860, here it is! our last pizzas together as roommates.," oh, i wish i’d know you were going to do that, i ordered chinese."
3861," oh that’s okay. hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!"," say, joe, i had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. what do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?"
3862,"what, are you crazy? you haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. it would be easier if you just give me your money.",yes it would. what do you say to $50?
3863," okay, you’re on."," okay, let’s play! the big game, italy vs. china, apparently."
3864,"(scores) yes! i win again! ha-ha! that’s like 500 bucks you owe me! whoo-ho-hoo! (goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.) $500 that is a loooot of electricity! (by the way, there’s nothing in the fridge.) whoo-ho-ho! (notices the sparseness of the fridge.) i gotta buy some food.","okay, give me a chance to win my money back. okay? sudden death, one goal, $1,000."
3865, you serious?, oh yes!
3866," okay, get ready to owe me!  okay, here we go. ready?"," no! no! no! no—(joey looks at him)—one can beat me.  see? now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking."
3867," yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. (phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)", still broken?
3868,"this sucks man! the last night you’re here and i lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500."," well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little blackjack? (holds up a deck of cards.)"
3869," nah, not my game."," okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? we could play a new game. a new game, it’s fun."
3870," well, what’s it called?", cups.
3871, i don’t know how to play cups.," i’ll teach ya! come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun.  okay, here you go. (he deals out two cards each.) i have two queens, what do you have?"
3872, a two and a five.,"ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!  oh yeah! okay, let’s play again. (he deals out two cards each again.) what do you got?"
3873, a four and a nine., you’re kidding right?  well that’s a full cup! (pays him again.)
3874, then keep running. (they resume the chase.), you win.
3875," well, what did you have?"," it doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. that my friend is d-cup. okay, now much have you won so far?"
3876,"uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.","not 700 exactly?  double it! (he does.) well you see in cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. hey, i didn’t make up the rules. now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (joey gets excited.) don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get—no way! (he takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. of course, any card would’ve won. chandler pays him.)"
3877," (answering the phone) hello? (listens) hey mon, how’s the packing going? (listens) ben? he’s fine. yeah, he’s right—oh my god! (he looks over at the fake ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) get your head of your shirt there son! (he tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) what? (listens) yeah, it’s a pumpkin. i’ll come pack.", what’s wrong?
3878,"ross and i were helping the girls pack, took a little break, i lost $1,500 to him in cups!", wh-how did you lose at cups?!
3879,"the same way you lost. i started out with a king and a queen, bamn! ross gets a 2 and a 3. then i get a jack and a king, boom! ross gets a 4 and a 5! ross was getting the cup card, the d-cup, the sittin’ down bonus! meanwhile, i didn’t even get half a cup! nothin’!!", oh man!!
3880," and he never played before either! y’know what i think? i think beginner’s luck, very important in cups."," all right, let’s play one more hand! one more!"
3881," no, no, no more! i cannot lose another dime! i’m serious this time! in-in fact, look, there’s a—i wanna give you something. and let me give it too you know before i pawn it for cups money. (he rolls the big white dog over) now, i want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate.", i can’t take the big white dog! you love it!
3882," it’s him, not it!","no, but wait—what if i bought it from you, y’know? and your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (gets choked up) $1,500?"
3883," wait a second, i see what you’re trying to do here! you-you’re trying to give me money again!", when did i try to give you money?
3884," over there! (points to the couch) before, with the bills! you tried to give some charity, i said ""no,"" you dropped it. okay? then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!", i’m just trying to help you out! okay? i wanna make sure that you’re okay.
3885, she really left., i know. (he kisses her.)  no problem roomie. (she turns around and hugs him.)
3886, can i ask you a question?  what the hell is that dog doing here?! (she notices the dog sitting in the living room.), i invented the game of cups as a way to give joey money.
3887, and now you want that money back., exactly.
3888," chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (as he picks up the fake ben.)", it’s not a real game! i made it up!
3889," i’m sorry you lost your money, but i won it fair and square.", at a fake game!!
3890," now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, i’d be glad to play you for it. but i should warn you, i am very good at cups."," okay! now i assume the saucer card came up when you played last.  hmm, let’s see if it comes up this time. (he looks at his cards and shrugs.)"
3891,"so, i just finished this fascinating book. by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. so theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.", (not amused) and i just realized i can sleep with my eyes open.
3892," (jumps over a box) honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!", i didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
3893," oh, so you can move them!"," yes, and while i'm doing that, ross has a great computer story for you."
3894," i didn't know that! well, what a pretty last name!"," so, uh, wh-where ya from?"
3895, thank you for bringing her into our lives., unbelievable
3896," oh, so you like her too chandler?"," hey, look at all the boxes!"
3897," yeah, yeah man don't do it. i mean if you date her, then-then-then i can't date her."," all right, think about it. now remember when you were going out with that girl donna and you guys broke up. remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?"
3898," oh god, yeah.", now imagine you live at the supermarket.  no-no
3899, we'll see.," ok, i'm officially unpacked. thanks for helping me man. (turns around and sees that joey isn't there.) joe? (hears giggling coming from a box) well, i guess joey went home. oh and look, there's still one box that i have to unpack. (hears the giggling again)"
3900, (jumps out of the box) i gotcha!!, (pretending) oh my god! you-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
3901," boy, it was so hard not to laugh, i tell ya. hey, hey, the place looks great!"," yeah, not bad right? you know what, monica’s gonna be working late, so i'm gonna make this place spotless. you know what else i'm gonna do, know what else i'm gonna do? i'm gonna go downstairs, i'm gonna get her some flowers. now who wouldn't wanna live with me?"
3902," (raises his hand) i don't! no, i wanna live with the super-hot australian dancer."," yeah, now how's that going though? are you okay with the not-flirting thing?"
3903," (enters) wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. so, mondler...uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?", what does it look like i'm doing? i am cleaning!
3904, did you get monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?, authorization? i don't need that. i'm gonna put everything back.
3905, put it back exactly where you found it?, yes i'm gonna put it back (mocking ross) exactly where i found it.
3906," ‘kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.", she's not gonna care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
3907," whoa, hello, did you just meet monica?"," she is gonna recognize that i did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it."
3908," hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. cause when you have to move back in with joey, joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me."," i see, i see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out."
3909,"look chandler, monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. believe me, i lived with her for 16 years. she is going to freak…out. oh my god, she's going to sit on you."," no, she's not okay? and i'll prove it to you. i'm gonna call her right now. (picks up the phone and wipes it off) phone's done ehh."
3910, (on phone) hi!," hey mon, how's it going?"
3911," terrible. if-if i want something done right, i have to do it myself. other people just wreck stuff. i really think i might kill someone tonight."," oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad."
3912, it's worse. the only thing that's getting me through is knowing that i'm gonna be seeing you soon. i think i may even try to get out of here early., no! no-no-no-no-no-no. it sounds like they really need you down there.
3913,"  well, are you just hanging out with ross?"," it's, all good! okay bye-bye mon! (to ross) she's-she's gonna kill me."
3914," yeah, the phone was facing the other way. (chandler fixes it and a picture frame off the table.) and that goes back up there."," we should start with the big stuff. y’know? that'll be the easiest. uh, let's start with the couch. (he picks up one end and ross doesn't help) i got it. (he moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)"
3915," yeah that-that, doesn't look right."," what are you talking about? the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. and then i can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the...(tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) ok, ok, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table."
3916," whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet."," ok well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch."
3917," whoa, whoa, whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area."," yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...rooosss!!!!"
3918," look, we do not repel women ok? that is completely untrue."," oh no, yes we do my man. remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine?"
3919," yeah, well what about you? you weren't you know, so hot in college either. after everything he said, he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh"""," yeah, monica doesn't like that either, maybe i should stop doing that."
3920," oh y'know what, girls don't like it when i start talking about science.", that's not specific to girls.
3921," uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.", and they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
3922, they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.," man, i'm so lucky i have monica."
3923," that's okay rachel. i'm not judging you; that's just who you are. me. i'm more free y'know? i run like i did when i was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. y'know, i mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from satan? (rachel looks confused) the neighbor's dog."," okay, is this lamp in the same place?"
3924, who cares? i repel women., (blocks the door) no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! you can't come in here! r-r-r-r-ross is naked.
3925, (whispers) what?!, (to ross) i couldn't say that i was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
3926, is it the same thing that chandler had?," look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later."
3927," okay, listen, there's still some of chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. bye!", bye! thank god
3928," dude, what'd you have?"," look, we have no time okay? we must focus. we gotta get everything back into its original place."
3929, (realizes something) the photo album! there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. we just go through it and match everything to the pictures., that's perfect! that's brilliant! (starts going through the photo album)
3930, is it okay for me to come in now?, uh-huh
3931, bye! (runs out)," no, i don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. (forced laughter)"
3932," well, the end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets."," okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you, so, i-i-i cleaned the apartment. so i moved everything around and then i forgot where it, where it went back and i'm sorry, i'm very sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry."
3933," it's okay. chandler, are you afraid of me or something?", do you want me to be afraid of you?
3934," of course not. i mean gosh, chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it. i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place, but i'd never expect you to worry about that.  of course!", oh well you're the best. you come here to me.
3935," yeah, i gotta go."," ba dum bumb cheshhh!  hi, my name’s chandler. i just moved in next door and i was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?"
3936," sure, neighbor come on in."," so, is janine around?"
3937," uh, no, she’s at dance class.", can i check out what she did to my room?
3938," yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. she gets really mad.(chandler gives him a look and walks to the door of his old room.)"," (the room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) oh my god. what is th… it’s like a guy never lived in here. look, you’ve got to be careful. this girl thing is dangerous. (looking around the living room.) it’s spreading already."
3939, (looking around the room.) it is???," (picking up a pillow.) yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?  (pointing to the table and picking up the box.) is that your tiny little box, that’s too small to put anything in?  no! ok, this is not good. you are a guy. ok? this is a guys place. if you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff."
3940," (with big eyes.) all right, you’re right. i’ll talk to her.", yes talk to her. be a man.
3941, i’m a man., defend yourself.
3942, chandler come on. we have to hem the new dust ruffle., be right there sweetums. (monica leaves. to joey.) a totally different situation.
3943, hey guys.," hey, how was your breakfast with hillary?"
3944, it was okay. she’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.," ohh, yeah."
3945," but, pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where i actually work. but, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. cause kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.", that’s weird. i don’t think my boss likes me either.
3946,"or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a wednesday. (everybody gets up.)", yeah let’s head off to work.
3947, what’s up? (he smiles. his teeth are freakishly white.), you know…oh my god.
3948, i whitened them., (sarcastically) really.
3949," ross they’re really, really, really white."," yeah, what was wrong with your old…human teeth."
3950," i know. that’s why i did it. (with a big smile) come on, are they really that bad?"," no, no no no. you’ll be fine. (turning to monica) hillary’s bind, right?"
3951, she will be after tonight., yeah. (rachel walks in.)
3952," yeah. your teeth? yes, i saw them from outside. (sitting down on the couch.) you guys are never going to believe this. but, phoebe made out with ralph lauren.", what???
3953," yeah i know. she ran into him at my office and they just…made out. and the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because i told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.", i am proud of all my friends today.
3954," my god, rachel, i can’t believe phoebe made out with ralph lauren. ohh, i’m so jealous. (chandler looks at her.)"," hi, i’m chandler. your live-in boy"
3955," chandler, please, come on. look at him. (pointing to a picture of ralph on a magazine,.)"," oh, i am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (phoebe walks in.)"
3956, now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.," yes, god forbid we throw out old underwear. you-you know what? i’m going to go over to joey’s."
3957," wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer."," yes, but i feel like i’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. you know. in fact i think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple."
3958," you know what? this has been kind of a girlie day. you’re right, i’m sorry."," nah, nah, it’s okay. i feel like i need to be in guy place. you know, do kind of like a man thing."
3959, yeah. go over to joey’s. go over to joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall., you know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
3960, hey chandler. come on in. we’re knitting pot holders.," no thanks, josephine.  hey ross, i was wondering if… oh my god!! where are all the men???"
3961," oh my god, joey, that is such a great tip."," monica, could you excuse us for a second? i need to talk to the girl with the flowers."
3962," ohh, i love birds. (monica leaves. chandler shuts the door.)"," what is the matter with you ?!?  you’re arranging flowers! (pointing to the dish on the table.) you got dead flowers! you got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! this is not joey!!"
3963," hey. hey look i am still joey, okay. flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. and that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. of a famous baby.", you’re turning into a women.
3964, no i’m not. why would you say that? that’s just mean., now i’ve upset you? what did i say?
3965," (on phone) okay, great!  bye. (hangs up as chandler enters.) so guess who’s coming to thanksgiving dinner?", sydney portier? hehheh.
3966," (not amused by chandler’s joke) i miss rachel. (to chandler) no, my parents."," oh! that’s great, they haven’t seen the place since i moved in!"
3967," yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! (quickly trying to change subjects), i was thinking we would eat around four.", (shocked at the news) why can’t i tell them that we live together?
3968," because they don’t know we’re dating. (again, trying to quickly change subjects.) do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)", why haven’t you told them?!
3969," um, well, i was going to, i-i-i really was. but um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, i didn’t.", why haven’t you told them?! wouldn’t they be happy?!
3970," (trying to change subjects, excitedly) so! dinner in the kitchen around four! i’ll see you then. (pats chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)", why wouldn’t they be happy?
3971," well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. i’m sorry.", what? what? why?!
3972," maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.", is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?
3973," look, i know that i should’ve told them. i know i shouldn’t care what they think. i’m sorry."," y’know, it’ll be okay. it’ll be okay. because when they come over, i will be all charming, i will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em."
3974, you really think that’ll work?," hey, i can be pretty charming, babe, i won you over, didn’t i?"
3975, (hugging chandler) i don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!," hey! (sees ross is there) oh, good, ross! you’re parents like me, right?"
3976," (only half-paying attention) yes, of course they like you!", well monica just told me that they don’t.
3977," (not paying attention) yeah, they don’t like you.", (annoyed) do you know why?
3978," i dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. or maybe it’s cause you uh-"," (angry) well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!  this is great, another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for."
3979," maybe i could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?", maybe i could give thanks by taking my playstation over to my new apartment.
3980, well maybe i love ya’., [mocks that last comment].
3981," (less than pleased) oh yes of course, hello chandler."," mr. and mrs. geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!  whoa, snowing out there?"
3982," y’know dad, chandler is one of ross’s very best friends!"," yeah, ross sure is a great guy, y’know i’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father."
3983," i always thought that too. tell me, what does your father do?", (worried) he’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
3984," oh, thank you chandler! i just bought it."," oh, yes. well it’s very beautiful. it’s cream-colored and tight [realizes what he just said and looks worried. monica and ross also looked shocked. judy and jack give chandler a very dirty look.] i don’t mean tight, i mean it’s not too tight, not that i was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]"
3985," (worried) dude, i need to talk to you a sec.  okay, i think i might know why my parents don’t like you.", you do? why?
3986," okay, remember, we were young. hey, spring break, sophomore year, i got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so i told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.", what?! why did you do that?
3987," i don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, i’m i’m sorry. i-i didn’t think it would matter.", how could it not matter?!
3988," how was i supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?", what about all that “friends forever” stuff?
3989, mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to chandler) were trying to get ross stoned!, your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
3990," ross, i can’t believe you’d do that!"," the reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? so will you fix this?"
3991," oh and (ross begins to open the door and joey says some gibberish word to indicate to ross that he’s not done yet. ross closes the door again.) okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, i learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach (rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh! and smiling (smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?"," yeah, i’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore."
3992, (faking enjoyment) mmm.," (clearly lying and hating the dessert) yeah, this is so good, that i’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert."
3993," ...so a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?"," (lying) yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it."
3994," chandler! you’ve been ross’s best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. (ross gets disgusted.) and now you’ve taken on monica as well. well, i don’t know what to say. you’re a wonderful human being.", thank you!
3995," no! thank you! (hugs chandler) monica, and ross! i don’t know what i’m gonna do about the two of you!", (in a parent-like tone) i’ll talk to them!
3996," nope, got it and i got yours (pointing to jack) too."," let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? i remember when people used to use big lights."
3997, that is nice and we’re done. tada!," i dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like christmas to me."
3998," oh, here.", see now it feels like christmas!
3999, hey you guys., hey joe what’s up?
4000," i had to get out of the apartment. janine is like stretching all over the place. y’know, everywhere i look she’s like… (he imitates her stretching)", i can see why that’s hard to resist.
4001, i know. and she’s so sweet. i just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.," you are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?"
4002, oh my god! we love that show! i mean ross and i have been watching it since i can remember!," ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you? (he kisses her on the cheek)"
4003, we are there!," what, what are you laughing at?"
4004, did she just ask me out on a date?, i don’t think so.
4005, we are going to dick clark’s new year’s rocking eve!, (to rachel) oh my god!
4006," okay, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet."," i can save you time ladies, i’m right here."
4007, we are looking for our christmas presents from monica., what? that’s terrible!
4008," no-no, we do it every year!"," oh well, that makes it not terrible."
4009," don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to joey’s and search, ok?"," no not okay, you can’t look for monica’s presents!"
4010, but we have to!," no, you don’t have to, and you can’t because i live here too."
4011," chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get monica for christmas?"," no, i have a great idea for a present for her."
4012," chandler, that’s not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you’ve just gotten her one great present? i mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?"," if i help, we can find ‘em faster!"
4013, we are so gonna find them this year.," y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?  you don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?"
4014," no, we never do that"," because that’s where joey gave me some stuff to store that i’ve never seen before in my life! okay, that did not just happen! (he does a weird clicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)"
4015," really, y’think so? i don’t.."," i couldn't find anything at joey--hey-hey, oh hey!"
4016," yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!"," those are my gifts, i got them for you."
4017," well chandler, what is this very weird, metal a z thing?", those are book ends! that's a great gift!
4018, ha!," make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?"
4019, hey! look who i found!," oh, hey guys!"
4020," y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and i thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden."," yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter."
4021," or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? no! didn’t think so! okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!"," oh, the duck seems to think that monica got me garbage! hmm, i wonder what i could get monica that’s as good as garbage?"
4022," oh, this one’s for chandler. here.", oh great!
4023," ooh, let’s open them!", okay! okay! okay!
4024, hee hee!," wait, we can’t do this."
4025," whatever linus, i’m opening mine."," nobody is opening anything ok? look, i don’t know about you guys, but i wanna see the look on monica’s face when i give her my present, and i’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when i get mine. so please, please, can we just, can we put them back?"
4026," hey guys! you found the presents? chandler, you let them find the presents? great! do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?", that’s what you got me?
4027, i can’t do it! (ross falls into monica’s room)," now you do that, you’re on tv."
4028, you serious?!, that’s great!
4029, oh we kissed it up real nice.," so you kissed her, so what happened after that?"
4030, i came over here to tell you guys., so she’s just waiting over there for ya?
4031, i am so glad you said cooks.," (entering) oh hey rachel, sweetheart? you have got to tell the post office that you have moved. okay? we are still getting all your bills and stuff. (hands her all of her bills and stuff.)"
4032," oh-oh, pottery barn! (grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds the rest back out to chandler.) you can throw the rest away.", i’m not your garbage man. i’m your mailman.
4033, yeah! it’s an apothecary table. does anyone even know what an apothecary is?, a pharmacist. (rachel mocks him.)
4034, i hate pottery barn too. they kicked me out of there just because i sat on a bed!, you took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
4035, hey! i made that for her!, you made pottery?
4036,"okay fine! i’ll-i’ll just tell her it’s an antique apothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from. oh! look at this little drawers! oh look-look it says that it holds 300 cds."," ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore…  …so then the farmer says, ""that’s not a cow and you’re not milking it."" (everyone laughs.)"
4037," i am so glad you guys got together, chandler and i are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!"," look at us, we’re a couple of couples!"
4038, nope-op! i insist! (he hugs chandler again and whispers to him.) you get the wine right?," yeah all right. (they part.) okay, good night guys."
4039, the dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. this is so exciting.," and here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (hands it to him.) you were also going to buy monica flowers but you couldn’t afford it, because you paid dinner last night."
4040," oh, she’s uh-uh really sick.", oh that’s too bad.
4041, bye. (exits)," that’s funny, i saw no phlegm."
4042," no-no, she really is sick!", then why-why is she going to a play?!
4043," well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. i’m so sorry."," well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!"
4044, (loudly) what?!! (quietly) what?, so she was just pretending to have a good time last night? she was lying to our faces?!
4045," ugh, i can not believe this! i mean, who is she to judge us? we could not have been nicer to her!"," and i am not blah, i am a hoot!"
4046," i know! i know! come on, please-please you guys, don’t-don’t be mad. i’m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! y’know? and it was our first date! plus, she’s really sick!"," no, you sh—no you said you made that up!!"
4047," i know, but don’t you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?"," eh, they’re both good. i generally just go with, monica’s drunk again. (monica glares at him.)"
4048,"oh ross, calm down, i’ll give you the 80 cents. (ross glares at rachel)"," okay, one more time."
4049," chandler, would you like some more orange juice?", perfect decibel.
4050," so uh, what are you guys doing?"," oh nothing, we’re just talking. y’know, blah-blah-blah."
4051," well i did. i really did. and you guys, i’ve got to say, i’m sorry if i was a little weird after the last time we went out. i guess i was just nervous or something.", that’s totally understandable.
4052," (bursting in) i knew it!! y’know, you’re not so quiet yourself, missy!"," and i’m blah? listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (imitating her) ""oh chandler, i just lost myself in the moment."""
4053, all right! all right! enough! enough! enough!! enough! (to chandler and monica) you two go home! i-i-i gotta talk to janine! (they start to leave.), (to monica) y’know i think you can take her.
4054, (chasing her) you’d better run!, did you hear that?
4055," yeah uh, what am i gonna do?"," yeah, i’m sorry man. (pause) you wanna go watch?"
4056, yeah! (they head downstairs.)," hey so, did uh, did she move out?"
4057," (showing them the page) here, check it out. it’s the first one, too.", that is funny. it was also funny when i made it up.  i made that joke up.
4058," uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. i did."," yes, i did. i told it to dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard."
4059," i’m sorry, i was just reading the joke below it. man, that one is funny. (ross grabs the magazine away from her.)"," monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?  seriously?"
4060," look, chandler, it’s my joke. but, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?"," yeah, i guess."
4061, (entering) hey guys.," (jumping up from his chair) hey, joey, playboy printed my joke."
4062," no, it’s my joke, it’s mine. you can call them, they’ll tell you.", it’s my joke.
4063," whoa-whoa-whoa. jokes? you guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?"," dude, you have got to turn on behind the music. the band heart is having a really tough time, and i think they may break up."
4064, let’s go watch it at your place.," nah, monica’s watching some cooking show. come on, i don’t want to miss when they were skinny."
4065," chandler, chandler, y’know what we should do? you and i should go out and get some new sunglasses."," what? no, i want to watch this. (he turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). did your cable go out?"
4066,"no, that’s vh-1. i gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . it’s like a lotta noise to me. i don’t know…"," joey, why is your cable out?"
4067," i uh, oh! because, uh, i haven’t really paid the bill"," if you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?"
4068," no, chandler. look, forget about it, okay? look, i know things have been a little tight since janine moved out. oh, was she hot.", whoa ho.
4069," i know! yeah, but, look i can handle it. all right? look, i can listen to the radio, huh? and ross gave me this great book (holds up the playboy magazine)."," (picks up the phone) all right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?  (with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) paid your phone bill?"
4070," you know, barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard."," so, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it."
4071," what, you didn’t get it? the doctor is a monkey."," and monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.  (stops laughing, to ross) you are not allowed to laugh at my joke."
4072," your joke? well, i think ‘the hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars."," so, you stole my joke, and you stole my money."
4073," well, i was going to stick it in the atm, but now i think i’ll show the sexy teller that i am a published writer."," well, she is going to know that you stole the joke."
4074," oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?  well, i’m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).", okay (he goes to sit down).
4075," (visibly upset) she picked rachel. i mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. she picked rachel."," (visibly upset) he took my joke, he took it."
4076, it’s wrong. you know what else is wrong? phoebe picking rachel.," you know who else picked rachel? ross, and you know what else ross did? he stole my joke. you know what? i’m going to get a joke journal. y’know? and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes."
4077, that’s a good idea.  do you know what’s a bad idea?, picking rachel.
4078, that’s right. (a noise comes from the living room.) did you hear something?, maybe it’s the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
4079," it’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. i mean, i was an actor and now i’m a waiter. it’s supposed to go in the other direction.", so is your apron. you’re wearing it like a cape.
4080," see, now it’s weird again.","i think it’s great that you work here. you’re going to make a lot of money, and here’s your first tip: don’t eat yellow snow. (he laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at ross, and writes in his journal). ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse."
4081," y’know, i don’t think we’re going to settle this.", let’s have monica decide.
4082, hey mon.," mon, get out here!"
4083," monica! (she appears, not sure why she was summoned.)"," okay, okay. you have to help us decide whose joke this is."
4084, why do i have to decide?, because you’re the only one that can be fair.
4085," yeah, but i’m your brother. we’re family. that’s the most important thing in the world."," (to ross) don’t try to sway her. (to monica) (softly) i’m your only chance to have a baby. okay, let’s go."
4086," okay, chandler, you go first."," okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve."
4087," oh, wait, is he the guy i met at christmas?", can i finish my story?!
4088, continue.," so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and steve’s doctor’s name is doctor muppy. so i said, ‘doctor monkey?’ and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up. (he slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)"
4089," are you kidding? okay, look. i-i studied evolution. remember, evolution? monkey into man? plus, i’m a doctor, and i had a monkey. i’m doctor monkey!", i’m not arguing with that.
4090, it’s your joke., is not.
4091," hi, chandler. there you are."," hi, oh hi."
4092," hey, it’s phoebe and rachel. um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?"," (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (pause.) being with her has been like being on a vacation. and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(he falters and monica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit."
4093," wait, wait, he came up with that himself. tell them, chandler.", (to chandler) i’m out of words. should i just say the whole thing again?
4094," look, i am not high maintenance. i am not. chandler!", (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) you’re a little high maintenance.
4095, ahhh! you are on my list.," i’m sorry. you’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. and when you get upset about the little things, i think that i’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. and that’s good too. so, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because i like … maintaining you."
4096, (embarrassed) (to phoebe and rachel) i didn’t even tell him to say that. (they hug). all right you’re off my list., (happily) i’m off the list. (sits on the couch.)
4097," (to monica) y’know, suddenly i find you very attractive."," hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?"
4098, i’m not answering that., joey! (pause as they all stare at him.) no way. i’m not answering that.
4099,"okay rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. ross, double latte, $2.75. chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. and pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. so, all together that’s (pauses to figure the total) $12.75.",this coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
4100, y’know what? i’m good! i’m good!," hey, what are you doing here? shouldn’t you be at work?"
4101," (congested) ugh, they sent me home. they said i can’t work if i’m sick.", i’m so sorry you’re sick.
4102, (wiping her nose) i have not been sick in over three years! (sneezes.), i’m gonna grab you some tissue.
4103," i’m fine-d. i’m fine-d! y’know, it’s a really hard word to say.", yes?
4104," oh my god, rachel!"," oh my god, introduce us!"
4105," yeah but it wasn’t for me, it was for a friend.", boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (rachel glares at him.)
4106," okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? let’s do something crazy!"," i know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. (holds up a glass of orange juice.)"
4107," okay, i’ll rest. but y’know if i’m going to bed, then you’re coming with me.", that would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here. (points to his nose.)
4108," (wiping her nose) are you saying that you don’t wanna get with this? (tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesn’t work all that well with the big robe.)"," yeah, i don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy."
4109, (in a sexy voice) come on. (coughs loudly.), don’t take this personally okay? it’s just that i just can’t have sex with a sick person.
4110," i’m with you chandler! i mean i can’t have sex with a sick person either, that’s disgusting! but i’m not sick! let me prove it to you. we are two healthy people in the pribe of libe."," that’s the thing, see i would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe."
4111, (still sick) chandler!," oh what is it honey, you need some tea? some soup? (he gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find monica, still in the robe, lying seductively on the bed. or at least she’s trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the robe off on of her legs.) oh-ohhhh!"
4112," (trying to be seductive) calling dr. big, dr. big to the bed."," oh jeez honey, i thought, i thought you were asleep."
4113, how could i be asleep knowing that you were in the next room., i was asleep. (she takes off her robe and starts to shiver) oh no! no-no honey! y’know what’s sexy? layers. layers are sexy. and blankets are sexy. and oh! hot water bottles are sexy.
4114," come on, get into bed! i want to prove to you that i’m not sick! i wanna make you feel, as good as i feel. (sneezes.)", would you please get some rest!
4115," (entering) chandler, i think i’m sick.", really? struck down in the pribe of libe!
4116," okay, fine i admit it! i feel terrible! would you please rub this on my chest? (she hands him some of that vicks vap-o-rub to put on.)"," no-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way."
4117, come on! i really need your help!, no-no-no-no-no!
4118," fine, i’ll rub it on myself."," so you’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?  it’s nice."
4119, are you kidding me?! is this; is this turning you on?, yes! (hangs his head in shame.)
4120, i can’t believe it! what is it? is it the rubbing or the smell?," it’s all very, very good. (she covers up and sits down.) so you wanna go uh, mix it up?"
4121," not now, i’m sick!", oh come on you big faker!
4122, what happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?, well that was before all the vaporizing action.
4123," okay, if you really wanna have sex…", okay! (runs into the bedroom.)
4124," oh yes, it’s me! sorry!", (calling from the bathroom) what are you doing here?
4125," uh, i’m just, i’m just looking out your window. at-at the view. what are you guys doing?", we got some vap-o-rub in some places.
4126," oh my god, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!", he’s taking off her coat!
4127, oh. (squeaks again.)," ho-oh, he’s gonna get some! (rachel looks at him.) of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. y’know so umm, he’s closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (pause) well, i’m off to bed! (goes to bed.)"
4128, joey we know you steal our food., i’m good.
4129, yeah. and y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? is that perverted old couple two doors over., (looking) is that a swing?
4130, oh don’t even ask!, yuck!
4131,i can’t believe ross went out with rachel’s sister! when chandler made out with my sister i was mad at him for 10 years.,that was like 5 years ago.
4132,yeah you got 5 years left!, joey…
4133, (crying) yeah me too.  oh y’know what’s sadder than this? bambi. i cried for three days with that movie. no wait two! because on the third day my mother killed herself so i was partly crying for that.," (totally not crying) well see now that i can see crying over, but bambi is a cartoon!"
4134, (crying) you didn’t cry when bambi’s mother died?, yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
4135, chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! i mean you don’t have to be so macho all the time., i’m not macho.
4136, yeah you’re right. i don’t know what i was thinking.," no, i guess i just never really cried. y’know? i’m not a crying kind of guy."
4137," come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?"," i’d be sad sure, but i wouldn’t cry."
4138," okay, what if the puppy said, ""help me chandler. all the other puppies pick on me."""," cry?! i just found a talking puppy, i’m rich!"
4139," all right, what’s going on there? (points to a picture.)"," oh, that’s parent’s day, first grade. that’s me with the janitor martin."
4140, where were your parents?, oh they didn’t want to come!
4141, so that story doesn’t make you cry?," no! look, i don’t cry! it’s not a big deal! okay?!"
4142," uhhh, yeah. yeah. but uh, i don’t think it’s the kind you’re gonna like.", you didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
4143, what?!!, i’m kidding. this is going to be fun.
4144," this is so bizarre. i guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood."," hey, i had a terrible childhood and i don’t do porn."
4145, hold on a second! what is that on her ankle?, her ankle is what you’re watching?
4146," well it’s hard to tell… (rachel gets up to get a closer look, only she’s having some trouble.) oh god, if she would just stop moving.", she’s just doing her job!
4147, hey sweetie!," hey! (he quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)"
4148, (picking up the book) chicken soup for the soul?, there’s no back to this couch!
4149, why are you reading this? you hate this kind of stuff.," yeah i know, but i figured a shot y’know? maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think i was y’know, all dead inside."
4150," oh that’s so sweet! look chandler i don’t care if you can’t cry, i love you.", oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
4151, stop it!," no, i mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and i’m like this. (makes a bored face.)"
4152," i won’t care, because i know you will be feeling it all in here. (points to her heart.)  yeah! and if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! and-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me."," okay, well i won’t uh, worry about this anymore then."
4153," and-and-and if i die, from a long illness. and you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""i will always be with you,"" and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, i know you’ll be crying a river inside."," aww, i love you so…"
4154," what is wrong with you?!!!  what?! you can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! now, i left you a note from the beyond!", so you didn’t mean any of that?!
4155, what?! you kissed!, (to monica) maybe we should give them some privacy.
4156, oh my god! are-are you crying?, (crying hysterically) i just don’t see why those two can’t work things out!
4157, bye-bye-e!," (starts crying) i-i can’t believe jill’s gone. (they all look at him.) i can’t help it, i opened a gate."
4158," i’d bet i’d still be doing my kara-tay. (that’s karate, he’s just saying it that way.) towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical.", maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
4159," and what if i was still fat? (to chandler) well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure.", sure i would!
4160, (simultaneously) oh yeah! come on! yeah right!," what, you guys really think that i’m that shallow?"
4161," hey, imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives! (closes his eyes to do so.) oh-hey, there’s carol again!"," what if i had had the guts to quit my job? i’d probably be writing for the new yorker, getting paid to be funny. but my job’s fun too! i mean tomorrow, i-i don’t have to wear a tie."
4162," oh dear god, let me think. (starts to sarcastically think about it.)"," (entering, depressed) hey."
4163, oh no! what’s the matter?," oh i just got another rejection letter. they said my writing was funny, just not ""archie comic funny."""
4164," y’know what honey? i got to get back to the hospital.  (kisses her) okay.  bye-bye. (gets up to leave.) oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the brazil nut. (exits.)", was his question what’s more boring than him?
4165," hey man, look sorry about that archie thing. do uh, do you need me to give you some money?"," hey, i may have no money, but i still have my pride.  ehh."
4166, that’s great! that would be great! let’s do that!, i could use the money; it could give me time to write.
4167, (stunned) you are friends with dr. drake remoray?, well it’s kinda hard to be friends with drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.
4168, (entering) hey there you are!," uh-oh, it’s my boss!"
4169," all right, here’s a list of things for you to do today. man, this going to be so great! thank you so much! all right, i got to go to work i’m delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! (exits.)", (reading the list) drop off my dry cleaning. pick up my vitamins. teach me how to spell vitamins. wear in my new jeans.
4170,"no! there-there was a little, a little diff in the market and i lost 13 million dollars.", but the kit-kats are all right?!
4171," what am i gonna do?! what am i gonna do?! i can’t call my office they’ll kill me! i can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! great, now my chest hearts.  (louder) my chest hurts! oh, and now i-i can’t breathe."," phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!"
4172," honey, having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slow it down."," i always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die! (phoebe glares at him.) but you’re not gonna die. i mean, you are going to die, but you’re not gonna die today. i wish i was dead."
4173, sorry. so how’s it going with joey?," oh just great. he beeps me now with codes. one is, ""bring me food."" two is, ""i’m with a girl, bring us food."" three is, ""i’m lost and i can’t find food."""
4174," okay, you watch too much tv."," (approaching) here you go joe, here’s the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (hands it to him.)"
4175," thanks! (looks at it.) yeah, there’s pulp in that. (hands it back.)  i thought we talked about this. i don’t like pulp. no pulp. pulp isn’t juice. all juice, okay?"," i’m sorry, i guess i just like the pulp."
4176, (to chandler) iced tea.," okay, anything for you sir?"
4177," (to chandler) okay look, chandler, if this (motions back and forth indicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (tugs on his ear.) (chandler glares at him.) you’re gonna throw that juice at me, aren’t ya?", it’s not all juice! (rachel quickly gets out of the way.)
4178, (quickly) i love that idea!, who sold a story to archie comics?!
4179, oh my god! that’s great! oh wow! (hugs him.) you’re a published writer! i wish i had a present for you!, aww.
4180, wait a minute! (quickly checks her pockets and pulls out…) my last kit-kat bar!, you wanna share it?
4181," yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, i just wanted to say i’m sorry. here. (hands him a cup.)", what’s this?
4182," fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! just the way you like it."," aww, thanks man. (they hug.)"
4183, oh my god! that’s great! congratulations! what’s the story?!," oh you wouldn’t uh, care. it’s just a stupid comic book story."
4184, are you kidding me?! i love archie! and the whole gang!," well uh, archie needs money to fix his jalopy (joey laughs), uh but he doesn’t want reggie to just give him the money. so reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. and then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them."
4185," she doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?"," no, the doctors say it may kill her."
4186, what are you two girls whispering about over there?!, (to ross) but i think we should tell her.
4187," okay, what is this? a stupid contest? because we got a winner here! (points at ross.)","listen phoebe, he’s right. people are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31."
4188, yeah that was lucrative! smart like your brother!," uh, what about y’know the massage thing? that never gave you a heart attack."
4189, how hot is this?!, i’m sorry you’re here with me instead of roger.
4190," stop it!! that’s not funny!!  i’m sorry, okay? it just—tonight was supposed to be y’know, it was supposed to be a big deal.", what was tonight?
4191, you don’t want to know what tonight was., okay. (pause.) what was tonight?
4192," well, tonight was—was going to be my first time.", with roger? (monica shyly looks away.) not just with roger?! (monica shrugs.) oh my god!
4193, all right relax mr. i’ve had sex four times!, four different women! i’ve had sex way more times!
4194, how many?, nine.
4195, i was just waiting for the perfect guy.," well good, good for you. you really think that roger is the perfect guy?"
4196, no. he’s not a horrible guy., hey that’s what i tell girls about me.
4197," chandler, i’m gonna die a virgin!", no you are not! you are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
4198, oh really? when? do you wanna do it with me?, okay. (they both realize what he just said.)
4199, i was kidding., so was i.
4200," come, come here.", we can’t do this.
4201, no! (they both laugh.) oyster?," yeah! (takes it.) if-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? because you’ve been waiting a very long time and i wouldn’t want to disappoint you."
4202," yeah but see i have nothing to compare it too. so even if you’re horrible, how would i know?", i do like that.
4203, it’s harder for me! i have those four other women to compete with!," well, if it helps there were only three. so it would just be for tonight, right?"
4204, absolutely! it would just be one friend (points at chandler) helping out another friend. (points at herself.), stop it! we’re doing this! let’s do it!
4205, noo!! okay!!, okay! (they both get up.)
4206," umm, do you have any uhh, moves?", i have some moves.
4207," i have no moves. (he moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs away.) okay, whatcha doin’ there?! (giggles.) oh y’know what? i’m sorry, this is just too weird."," yeah, let’s just forget it."
4208, what if i turn out the lights? (runs to shut them off.), oh yeah.
4209," that’s the couch.  i know! i’ll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!"," oh, okay! (he rolls over to do that again.)"
4210, it really was!, let me tell you about this chick i scored with last night! oh no wait a minute that was you!
4211," hey, check me out, i’m a slut!"," so you uh, want to do something tonight?"
4212, oh i can’t. dr. roger is coming over again.," oh. oh right! right! because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy. i mean, i remember a time when… (he fakes falling asleep.)  yeah! totally! totally, and you?"
4213," great! it’s so amazing! i mean, last time dr. roger came over, i was so nervous, but then after being with you i’m all like, ""can the doctor see me now?""", i bet he can.
4214," y’know, i don’t have an appointment, but i sure could use a physical. (he laughs halfheartedly) are you sure you’re okay?"," oh yeah! yeah! don’t worry about me, i’ll be fine! (does a kara-tay move.)"
4215, try telling my wife that., (sticking his head in the door) okay to come in?
4216," yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. dr. roger got beeped again."," yeah i know, guess who beeped him?  i’m the ruptured spleen. (laughs.)"
4217, why would you do that?," because you shouldn’t be with him. (pause.) you should be with me.  yeah! when you were talking about roger, that was killing me! look, things like last night they don’t just happen. y’know? or at least not to me. or with the other two women, in the morning y’know i was just lying there and i couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you i always y’know with a friend.  i know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because i make too many jokes and i’ve never been in a serious relationship and i guess i’m not technically a ""doctor…"""
4218," there was just one woman, wasn’t there?"," no, there were two."
4219,"(he’s just picked up their bill) hey! so, what’s with the 20 percent tip? did i do something wrong?", twenty percent is a pretty generous tip joe.
4220, y’know what’s more generous than that?! fifty percent! y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!, i see where you’re goin’!
4221," oh, ha-ha-ha! ooh! wait a minute, i used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!"," (reminiscing) ah, finally an explanation."
4222," y’know what… (moves away as chandler enters, panicked.)"," hey-hey, is monica here?  okay, look i need your help, i don’t know what to get her for valentine’s day."
4223," well, valentine’s day was like two weeks ago, so i wouldn’t get her a calendar!", (laughs) she was working on valentine’s day so we’re celebrating it tonight.
4224," and of course, crotchless panties."," well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her brother, (the camera pans to ross flashing joey a very evil look; joey gets scared) i can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year."
4225," (interrupting him) okay-okay-okay! so, making things. that sounds like so much fun."," yeah, i thought so to until i paper mached one of my eyes shut."
4226," oh, i love paper mache! what did you make?", i made a… (does one of those gibberish words.)  nothing!
4227, so what are you gonna do?," well, have you guys made anything that maybe i can take credit for?"
4228," now, it’s you little bunny friend. (she sticks it in rachel’s face and they both laugh.)"," (admiring his work) this, this actually is a… (does the same gibberish word from before.)  hey! honey, can i ask you a question about the valentine’s day gifts?"
4229," oh, yeah.", do we have to make the entire thing?
4230," yes! why, did you—you forget to make yours?"," of course, of course not. i just have to uh, go over to the place where i-i made it and pick-pick it up."
4231," okay. (they kiss.) okay, i can’t wait! this is going to be the best valentine’s day ever! (chandler giggles and exits.) i can’t believe it! make the presents! make the presents!", (sticking his head back in) what?
4232, (not turning around) chandler. i sensed it was you.  unagi. i’m always aware.," okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?  i can’t figure out what to make monica."
4233," oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.", i’m going crazy! okay? do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
4234,"y’know what? she’d-she’d love this. (picks up a model of the saturn v rocket, that’s the one that took man to the moon.) uh, it’s an exact replica of apollo 8. i made it in the sixth grade."," yeah, i guess i could use that. i could say that your love sends me to the moon."
4235,"yeah-yeah, except apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. but you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. (apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the christmas story from the orbit of the moon on christmas eve, 1968. they also took the famous earthrise picture of the earth rising over the moon.)"," wait a minute, i can’t give this to her."
4236," ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (she does the finger thing.)"," okay. okay. (he goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way, and notices an empty hanger. he takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. then he holds it out as if he’s giving it to her.) yes honey, i made it myself. (he throws it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a pair of scissors. he turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) i can’t do it. i can’t do it. (he throws them both down and continues looking. he opens another closet door and finds a tape.) oh! oh! a mixed tape! a mixed tape!! (he runs out into the living room.)  hey! hi! you uh, ready to exchange gifts?"
4237," sure! okay, you go first."," okay, come here! come here."
4238, okay! (she takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the couch.)," now, it’s not wrapped because i just, just finished it.  but i made you a tape of what i think are all romantic songs."
4239," oh, what a great gift! is the way you look tonight on it?!", (momentarily terrified) maybe we’ll have to listen and see!
4240," oh, i love it! thank you so much!  okay, you ready to open yours?", it’s a sock bunny.
4241," yeah-yeah, you remember how i call you bunny?", not really.
4242," well, i did one time, and-and i want to start doing it more. see that’s what this is about."," i see. y’know umm, phoebe makes sock bunnies."
4243," no! no, she doesn’t. uh phoebe, what she makes—that’s uh—they’re sock rabbits. they are completely different—okay! okay! okay! i didn’t make it! i’m sorry! i totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we’re supposed to make the presents!"," oh, it’s okay. i don’t…"
4244," no-no, it’s not okay! it’s not! i mean you were just… you’re so incredible! you went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! y’know i’m just gonna—i, i am gonna make this up to you! i will! i-i am going to cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and i am going to do anything you want in there! (points to the bedroom.)"," (thinking it over) well, i did put a lot of thought in the tape. (they both run into the bedroom.)  wow! (to the sock bunny still on his hand.) you are way to young to have seen that!"
4245," oops! (covers its eyes.) y’know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say i forget to get you a present for that too?",you are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
4246, we have got to wash that! (referring to the sock bunny.), yeah! (takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)
4247," do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?", you have done enough!
4248, i wanna wake up early and go get it for you!," no you don’t—get it in black, not brown."
4249," oop, your cake is ready!"," oop!  well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake."
4250," (entering) no! no! no! no! no! how you doin’?! how you doin’—damnit carl! go wait in the hall! (goes into the hall.)  look, i got to apologize on the behalf of carl.", who the hell is carl?!

4402, yeah! that’s why i’m sleeping with him on the side.," yeah, you wish. (stops to think about it and gets depressed.)"
4403, i’m not writing about you! i’m writing about other people., who?
4404, (still writing) phyllis sees what i’m doing., oh-oh.
4405," chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.", we said seven!
4406, we said six!," the only way that i said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six."
4407," quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to the rescue, huh? (reading her book) ooh, very interesting. yeah, well this certainly clears things up.", (disgusted) what does it say?!
4408, i will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.," thank you for writing your book. its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything."
4409, thanks! so are you., (to monica) i told you i should not wear this color. (he’s wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
4410," (reading from her book) mon… (pause as she restarts) marcia and chester are planning on seeing a movie on sunday night. marcia thinks they’re supposed to meet at six, chester thinks it’s at seven.", so you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
4411, i can’t believe i’m going to lose this job!, oh i’m so sorry man! is there anything i can do?
4412," yeah? well, i don’t want to talk to you wayne! i hate you! you ruined my life! oh, chandler, wayne. wayne, chandler. (they shake hands.)"," hi, how are ya?"
4413, (incredulous) why should i help you?!, (whispering in joey’s ear) the reason he just said.
4414, yeah. her. all of them. anyone.," yeah, i’ve been there my friend."
4415, no! no! it’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!, i’ll give up my ticket.
4416, okay that’s so generous!, and i think ross is generous too.
4417," okay, okay. uh, well uh, rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (paul enters) in his ear.", ross.
4418," (to rachel) thank you, it’s my mom’s. so this is the kitchen."," (on machine) you’ve reached monica and chandler’s, if you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening. (to himself) yeah we are."
4419," (on phone) hi, this is heldi from the morgan chase museum. i’m calling for monica geller. i want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the bing-geller wedding at our facility, it is available… (chandler runs to answer the phone.)"," (on phone) this is chandler bing! this is chandler bing! (listens) yes, the groom—no! not the groom!!"
4420," hi, honey.", (gets up) see you later. (starts to leave.)
4421," what? i-i bought groceries, i was gonna make you dinner!", (angrily) well next time ask! or at least wait for me to ask! (he storms out.)
4422," oh please, he didn’t hear it! he didn’t hear it!!", (on machine) this is chandler bing! this is chandler bing! (the machine beeps off.)
4423," (going over to him) i’m so sorry. please, stop freaking out."," i’m not freaking out. why would i be freaking out? a woman named heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (does one of those chandler noises.)"
4424," honey, we were at this beautiful place, and i-i-i just put our names down for fun! i mean, what’s the harm in that?", right here! (clucks like a chicken for some reason.)
4425," chandler, please don’t think i was trying to pressure you. phoebe and rachel…","phoebe and rachel! so the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, phoebe and rachel, heldi, and apparently some band called starlight magic 7 who are available by the way!"
4426," it was a mistake. please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t."," yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that i’m just not ready…"
4427," (entering from her room) hey, did she buy it?", totally.
4428, so did heldi show you the place?," yeah, it’s beautiful."
4429, great! (takes his coffee and leaves.)," pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for monica? i can’t figure this out! it’s so hard! should i get her a (turning to each page) tiffany cut or a princess cut or a—ah-ah! paper cut!"
4430," now, have you told anyone else?"," no, i don’t want to tell anybody else because i don’t want monica to find out."
4431, you told me.," well, it’s because i trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when i was looking at ring brochures."
4432," yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. i only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.", me too.
4433," hey! so chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?", oh all right.
4434," oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go."," oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place."
4435," my god, i’m sorry! i’m sorry! i didn’t mean to do that! i wouldn’t do that!", nothin! this is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and i can’t find the perfect ring! (goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) ugly ring! ugly ring! ugly ring! (notices that one of the jewelers is watching him.) it’s a beautiful selection. (the jeweler walks away slowly.)
4436," okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. maybe you-maybe you do something different. y’know? maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? or an engagement tiara? or—ooh! an engagement revolutionary war musket! (picks one up from the display in the corner."," y’know, i’m so glad i picked you to help me with this."
4437, huh? can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?," yeah, i’m gonna stick with the ring. (goes to another display counter.) oh, this one’s nice! (pointing to another ring.) i like this one! sir? uh, kind sir? can i see this one?"
4438, can i help you?," uh-uh, yes. i would like to see that ring please."
4439,"this ring is from the 1920s, it’s a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side."," sir, can i ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?"
4440," okay. (holds out the ring, deadpan.) will you marry me?"," (choking up) oh my god that’s it, that’s the ring! how much is it?"
4441, (angrily) are you interested in this ring?!,"yes! yes, but i can only pay $8,000."
4442, (ignoring her) how would you like to pay?," uh, credit card. (reaches for it then realizes) oh no! no-no, but i left my credit card with joey. (to phoebe) okay, i’ll go get it. you guard the ring."
4443, rachel?, no. how are ya paul? (starts to look for his credit card.)
4444," (acting manly to try and cover up his crying) okay. chandler, did your dad ever hug you?"," no, did he hug you?!"
4445," no! no! it’s just that, my dad never did. i miss my dad."," well, you can see my dad in vegas kissing other dads."
4446, hey chandler?  would you…….would you hug me?, i’m a little busy here paul.
4447, that’s exactly what my dad used to say! (starts to breakdown again.)," okay, a quick one. come on hug it out. (paul rushes over and hugs chandler tightly.) oh hey! there you go. (the hug continues.) okay. (the hug continues.)"
4448, five more seconds., okay! (pushes him away.)
4449," whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (motions to chandler, ""what’s going on?"") hi, paul is it? (paul nods yes and still hugging joey.)", do you have my credit card?
4450," yes, it’s in my… in…in my pocket. (paul hasn’t dropped him yet.) (chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) my back pocket! my back pocket!", thank god! (grabs his card.)
4451, oh hey listen i got us tickets to a knicks game tonight.," oh, i can’t go."
4452," chandler, i found the perfect ring. (holding it out for her.)"," oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but i’m gonna go with the one i picked first."
4453," oh my god chandler, the one you picked is gone. it’s over!  some guy bought it. i’m sorry. i tired to stop it but they (points to the jeweler) put me in jail!", they put you in jail?
4454, the little jail between the doors!," phoebe, i asked you to guard the ring!"
4455," i know, i’m sorry! but y’know, this ring is better! monica never even saw the other ring.", yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring i got goose bumps.
4456, maybe it was the guy., it was the ring!
4457, (entering from her room) hey.,(to monica) she’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
4458, it’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! it’s a beautiful ring!," no, it’s not! when i looked at the other ring i could see monica’s face when i gave it to her, y’know? and i could see her saying yes. when i look at this ring, all i see is a ring! unless i look at it really closely and then i can see my own eye. (does so and laughs.) look, this is the most important thing i’m gonna do in my life. i wanna make sure it’s perfect."
4459, okay. there may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘cause i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something., i can’t do that.
4460, well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.  there he is! (points.), okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
4461," wow! you’re good! after this, we should solve crimes."," yeah! okay, go, go, go get him."
4462, (to chandler) here he is.," (to him) hi! hi. okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. so, i’m gonna need to have that back. (the guy isn’t sure.) but, in exchange i’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (looking at the ring.) ew."
4463," it is beautiful, but i’m gonna use this one. now, if you’ll excuse me.", no-no! this is my fiancee (phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. you don’t want to break her heart now do you?
4464, you’re dying?!," yeah, she’s dying… of a cough apparently."
4465," yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. see, if i’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…"," (interrupting her) okay, that’s enough honey!"
4466, i don’t know. (pause) let me see the ring.," great! okay, here. (holds the ring up for him.)"
4467, (looks at it) all right. (exchanges rings.)," thank you. thank you. thank you! (to his girlfriend) and you are about to marry a wonderful man! (she stunned and he’s horrified.) hey! i’m marrying a dead woman!  guys? (they ignore him.) i’ve got something important to tell ya. (still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the tv.) guys? (they lean over to try and watch the tv, chandler mimics them.) guys?! (pause) i’m gonna ask monica to marry me."
4468," wait a minute, is this, is this for real?"," yeah, check out the ring. (shows it to them.)"
4469, so you two are really serious?!," yep, pretty much."
4470," and-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re gonna be friends again!", (goes to hug him and stops short) heyyyy—what?
4471," oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!"," okay! (they hug.) i was gonna wait ‘til uh, it was official y’know? but i got so excited i just had to tell you guys because you’re my best friends."
4472," (who has just entered) ugh! no more crying! please! i just dumped one cry baby, i’ll dump you too!", i’m gonna ask monica to marry me.
4473, (holding an empty tissue box) where’s all the tissues?! (throws the box down in disgust.), check out the ring.
4474, you told her before you told us?," well, she walked in when i was looking at the ring brochures. you can understand that, right? (ross and joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on tv.) guys? guys? (walks in front of them again.)"
4475," yeah, you didn’t get one."," okay, well tonight’s the big night."
4476," okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?"," it is going to be perfect. i am taking her to her favorite restaurant. i’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast i’m just gonna propose."
4477, that sounds perfect!  you’re gonna mess it up let me do it., i’m not gonna mess it up.
4478," if she says no, can i have the ring?", she’s not gonna say no.
4479, if!  (with her mouthful) hi monica., (to phoebe) give me it!
4480, it’s gone., phoebe!  (with his mouthful) hi monica.
4481," are any of you guys free tonight? my boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people i bring, the better i look. so, monica? chandler?"," (glaring at her) well, monica and chandler can’t go. we’re going to dinner remember?!"
4482, what’s the big deal?, i just get mad when rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going.
4483," hey, y’know what? i’ll come too. i’m making money now; it’s about time i give something back."," well, you could also give back the money you owe me."
4484," oh no, i have plans with elizabeth."," oh, so you’re already doing your part for the kids."
4485," ross let me ask you a question. all jokes aside, where is this relationship going?"," wait a minute, all jokes aside? i didn’t agree to that!"
4486," see? now, he could date her."," will you marry me? will you marry me? (makes like a gun with his fingers.) hey, you marry me! (he gives up as joey, rachel, phoebe, and ross slink in all excited.) what’s going on little elves?"
4487," yeah, yeah you have the ring?"," yeah, right here in my pocket. (pats his pocket. phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) pheebs?"
4488, oh! oop! (hands him back the ring.)," okay, now will you guys get out of here? i want this is to be a surprise and she’s gonna know."
4489, hi guys., (to monica) you are beautiful.
4490, forget her! you enjoy this!! (pulls him back up and starts applauding again. joey waves and does a salute.]," (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) one nation, under god. indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (laughs.) i remembered it. (it’s a butchered version of the pledge of allegiance of the united states for our foreign friends.) the champagne is here. (the waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)  yes! yes! i’m good! are you good? are you good? is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!"
4491," yeah. i’m okay. i’m actually—i’m a little cold, can i have your jacket?"," oh, yeah. (starts to take it off and then realizes) uh, no you can’t have my jacket! because then i would be cold! if you thought that you were going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. but uh, other than that, are you okay? are you okay?"
4492, (laughs) are you sure you’re okay?," yes! i’m fine. in fact i’ve been fine for a long time now and i think, the reason is you."
4493, ohh that’s sweet!," okay umm, before i meant you i had really little life and i couldn’t imagine growing old with…"
4494, (interrupting him) oh my god!," (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) i know, but just let me say it."
4495," oh my god, richard. (yep, richard’s back.)"," what?! i’m chandler! (she nods towards the doorway, chandler turns and looks) oh, that’s richard!"
4496, (approaching them with a woman in tow) monica! chandler!," hey-hey, hey! (gets up and hugs him.) i don’t know why i did that!"
4497," well, my nose got lonely."," (to richard’s date) and uh, you don’t have a mustache which is good. (she just smiles.) i’m chandler; i make jokes when i’m uncomfortable."
4498," oh, i’m sorry. (introduces them.) lisa, (nodding at each) monica, chandler. we used to date."," richard! no one supposed to know about us! (richard just smiles at him.) see i, did it again."
4499," chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down?"," yeah, i’ll sit down. (he slides back into his chair.)"
4500, oh. good to see you guys., yes. (thinking he’s gone.)
4501, (laughing) oh my god!," i got a good one, i got a good one! i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy."
4502," oh my god, you guys!! (he’s excited about what he thought happened.)"," (stopping him from going any further) before you say anything, have we got a story for you! guess who we bumped into at dinner!  richard!"
4503, what? (excited) a-ohh! (realizes) ohh. oh that’s right that’s right. that’s richard’s favorite place too., oh you knew that. good!
4504, if the school finds out you’re fired.  she’s leaving for three months., for camp!
4505," i’ve got to talk to her. ugh, i hate this part."," hey, you have to forget about elizabeth. i mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!"
4506, (suspiciously) okay. (exits to carry out phoebe’s wishes.), (after the door closes) what did you guys just do?!  richard was there so i couldn’t do it!
4507, what?! noooo… (phoebe gasps.)," i’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it!"
4508, we didn’t ruin it!, who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
4509, good one! yeah., this is terrible. what am i going to do?
4510," look, she only suspects something okay? she doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track."," that’s right, i can throw her off. i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind."
4511, yeah! yeah! convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! convince her that you’re a little coward!,"i can do that, i’ve had 30 years of practice."
4512," okay, break-up’s still on!"," okay, okay, here she comes! (sits on the couch next to him.) how do i look? do i look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?"
4513, (entering) hi guys!  what are you up too?," oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. (joey laughs.) yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you."
4514, well that’s a little crazy. although i am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the internet.," yeah, well… y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?"
4515, why?! to celebrate your relationship! to solidify your commitment! to declare your love for one another to the world!, eh…
4516," so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?"," sure i do. in fact, i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. i mean look at pigs. let’s take a second here and look at pigs. okay pigs don’t mate for life. i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!"
4517," yeah, but that’s pigs not people!","if marriage worked, i’d be all for it. but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%."
4518, wait a minute. are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?," well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never."
4519, oh my god! then-then-then what are we even doing?! what is this?!, whoa! whoa! whoa! what is all this pressure?! is this some new kind of strategy? why don’t you put down your copy of ‘the rules’ huh mantrap?!
4520, y’know what?! i gotta go! ugh!," (to them) it’s okay, i got a plan."
4521, where the hell have you been?!, i was making a coconut phone with the professor.
4522," richard told monica he wants to marry her!  yeah! yeah, i’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe i would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off!", my—oh my god!
4523, i know! they suck!!, he’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! i’m supposed to do that!  well what… y’know what i’m gonna do? i’m gonna go over there; i’m gonna kick his ass! (pause) will you help me?!
4524," look, chandler i don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. okay? just go and find monica!", you’re right.  okay. (starts running for the bedroom) i’m gonna get the ring! i’m gonna get the ring! (does so) i’m gonna go find her and (starts running for the door) i’m just going to propose!  okay great.
4525," yeah, i understand. take as much time as you want. (pause) ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. i’ll be here. not smoking. (monica leaves.)  chandler.", where is she? i’m not scared of you! (averts his eyes and walks in.)
4526, she’s not here and please come in.," (examining the coffee table) scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? ha-ha, monica! monica!"
4527," okay, she was here, but she left.", well where did she go?
4528, well she said she had to think things over.," oh my god, i can’t believe this! y’know, i thought…i thought you were a good guy."
4529," oh, hey look nothing happened.", nothing happened? nothing? so you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?
4530," well all right, one thing happened?", y’know what? i can’t believe this! do you know what you did? my girlfriend is out there thinking things over! you made my girlfriend think!!
4531, well i’m sorry., and what does she have to think about? i love her!
4532," well, apparently i’m willing to offer her things that you are not."," but i am willing to offer her all those things. this was just a plan, y’know? a way to throw her off course so that when i offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!"
4533," well if it helps, it worked very well."," it was working until you showed up, you big tree! i mean, this isn’t fair. you had your chance with her! you had your chance and you blew it! and this is my chance and i am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! and this is all just been one stupid mistake! (sits down heavily.) i was gonna propose tonight."
4534, you were gonna propose? (sits on the arm of the couch.), yeah i even (pause) got a ring. (puts in on the center cushion.) did you get a ring?
4535," no i don’t have a ring! (pause) you go get her chandler. (pause) and can i give you a piece of advice? if you do get her, don’t let her go. trust me.", y’know richard…you are a good guy.
4536, i know. (pause) i hate that!," i can’t talk to you now, i gotta find monica!"
4537," she’s gone.  she’s gone. she had a bag and she left.  she was all crying. she-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.", well why didn’t you stop her?! why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!
4538," i-i did! i told her everything, chandler! but she wouldn’t believe me.", well where… where did she go?
4539, to her parent’s i think and she said you shouldn’t call her. but if i were you i would., i can’t believe i ruined this.
4540, you wanted it to be a surprise.  chandler… in all my life… i never thought i would be so lucky. (starting to cry.) as to…fall in love with my best…my best… there’s a reason why girls don’t do this!," okay! (he joins her on one knee) okay! okay! oh god, i thought… (starting to cry, pauses) wait a minute, i-i can do this. (pause) i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it. then i realized the only thing that matters is that you, (pause) you make me happier than i ever thought i could be. (starting to cry again.) and if you’ll let me, i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (pause as he gets out the ring.) monica, will you marry me?"
4541, (grabbing the candy bar) yeah i’ll take that., monica and i are engaged.
4542,"i’m getting married!!!! i’m gonna be a bride!!!! (someone else yells at her.) no, i will not shut up because i’m engaged! (he yells again.) ohh, big talk! huh, why don’t you come over here and say that to me?! huh, buddy?! yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! (chandler starts to look worried.) come on, apartment 20! apartment 20!"," (to ross) okay, you get her in here. (to joey) you bolt the door. i’ll be in the closet."
4543," okay! wait-wait-wait! shhh! (bangs on her class with a spoon to make a toast.) okay, umm, i just wanna say that…i love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. (chandler clears his throat.) our special night. i mean it just wouldn’t be my—our-our night, if you all weren’t here to celebrate with me—us—damnit!"," it’s okay, i want this to be your night too. (raises his class.) to monica."
4544," awww, come on—wait—stop it. okay, to monica.", to monica!
4545,"but i-i-i can’t stay too long, i gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and i gotta look good. i’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. (everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) what?","so when you said, ""get up early,"" did you mean 1986?"
4546, (looking at her hand) y’know what shoes would look great with this ring? diamond shoes! (sees chandler sitting on the bed.) you’re not getting dressed. (chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.), know what i mean?
4547," yeah, but i don’t think we have time.", there’s gonna be a wedding. you’re gonna be the bride. two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
4548," (lustily) let’s do it! (she kisses him and they fall back onto the bed.)  (chasing after him) chandler! it happens to lots of guys! you-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!"," (motioning with his hands) i’m not worried, i’m uh, i’m fascinated. y’know it’s like uh, biology! which is funny because in high school i uh, i-i failed biology and tonight biology failed me. (exits as phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)"
4549," check it out. okay, i can play this when the guests are coming in. okay. (singing)  if you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay."," sure, you guys don’t have this problem, you’re made of wood. (rachel comes out of the bathroom) hey!  you look great!"
4550," (quietly) oh, thanks.", you okay over there?
4551," i don’t know, y’know? i feel a little umm… no, y’know what? nevermind, i’m gonna be fine."," oh, don’t worry about it i mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody."
4552, ‘sup? ‘sup dude?," (putting his hands up) take whatever you want, just please don’t hurt me."
4553,"so you’re playing a little playstation, huh? that’s whack! playstation is whack! ‘sup with the whack playstation, ‘sup?! huh? come on, am i 19 or what?!","yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19."
4554," come on man, really how old?!"," young! you’re a man-child okay?! now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!"
4555, wow thanks! (he goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)," joe?  uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?"
4556," when? today? some, not a lot."," well, it’s just the reason that i’m asking is because i kind of eh, uh, i was unable to—i mean i really wanted too, but i couldn’t…. there huh—hmm, there-there was an incident."
4557," don’t worry about that man, that happens.", it’s happened to you?
4558, yeah! once.," well, what’d you do?"
4559, oh my god! i cannot believe you guys are talking about this! the problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! all right?!! now chandler is doing the best he can!!, (angrily) i don’t think that’s what they were talking about joe!!
4560,"you got it. okay. now, i can pass for 19 right?!","yes, you can pass for 19."
4561, seriously?, word!
4562," i can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s so typical."," now monica, i know you’re upset, but don’t forget. there is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in paris."
4563, paris?," we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la (mumbles something).  then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. not just because it’s romantic, but because i can!"
4564," (in a french accent) bonjour, monsieur."," okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away.  it’s paris, who knows we’re here!"
4565," okay, you said i could sing at your wedding so, i’m just gonna need a small deposit.  y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date."," pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!"
4566,maybe just 10 minutes for you.," oh, give her the deposit! give her the ring! i don’t care!"
4567," monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone, especially me?"," what a great apology! (to monica) and you accept! okay, bye-bye!"
4568," my sweet sixteen! remember, you went to third base with my cousin charlie."," (entering) ahh, third base."
4569," uh, rachel, i’ve been thinking. i don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. i’m calling it off.", (to ross) why to save your dignity my man.
4570, (yelling after them) i can’t believe you’re gonna have sex on my engagement night!!," well, somebody should. (monica glares at him.)"
4571," i just wanted to say that i hope you do have sex tonight and i hope that you guys get back together, but i must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement i’m going to announce that i’m pregnant!", how is that ever going to happen?!
4572," because! because i was sad.  look, i am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that i’m not. i’m not even close. and i don’t know, maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better. and i know that that’s dumb, but oh my god you were so depressed when ross got married that you slept with chandler!"," (to ross) i don’t care, she slept with me."
4573," (deadpan) well, i’m going to take off. (to chandler) congratulations man.  (at the door) and uh, rachel.  what can i say, you missed your chance. from now on the only person who’s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.)"," (interrupting her just in time) hey! here’s a dollar, consider it a deposit. please sing at our wedding."
4574, oh thank you., okay. (goes back to bed.)
4575, (entering from her room) oww!, what’s the matter honey?
4576, okay! (runs off.), (incredulous) already?!
4577," yeah, we got a lot to do! we gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music…"," oh, i got some thoughts on that."
4578,"(returning) okay! (sets down a huge 3"" 3-ring binder on the table.)", what in god’s name is that?!
4579," a jazz trio for cocktails. the bay city rollers for dancing. wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding."," well, you couldn’t get them anyway. ian doesn’t plan anymore and derrick… (off of rachel and monica’s looks) and derrick is a name i shouldn’t know."
4580," (sitting up from the couch) hey mon, do you have another pillow? (holds up one.) y’know, something a little snugglyer?", why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
4581," uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!"," now, do i get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?"
4582," of course you can look at it! yeah, i want your opinion too!  here you go! what do you think about centerpieces?", centerpieces!
4583, yeah! roses or lilies? (holds up a picture of each.)," definitely roses. (monica and rachel exchange a look.) well, i just think they’re a little more weddingy. (monica holds the lily picture closer to him.) but lilies are the clear choice."
4584, oh my god! it’s like one mind., uh-huh!
4585," so chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged."," oh yeah, i should probably call them."
4586, i remember when we first got engaged.," oh, i don’t think i ever heard that story."
4587, (incredulous) you don’t know how that happened?! your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!, what a sweet story.
4588, well it was chandler! we didn’t think he’d ever propose!, clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)
4589, i can’t believe this. do you think that your parents could help pay for it?," i don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. she’s saving the rest for her divorce. and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (pause) dollywood."
4590," wait, but there’s no money! well this is terrible! you guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!"," honey, it’s gonna be okay."
4591," no, y’know what? it’s gonna be okay. i mean you don’t have to have this rustic italian feast. y’know? and-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (she starts to cry, as does monica.)"," look, it really is gonna be okay. the important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married."
4592, how? i don’t have any money.," well, i have some."
4593, how much?," well, close to… (notices rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to monica as phoebe averts her eyes.)"
4594," (starting to cry) ohh, you guys are so made for each other."," well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?"
4595," ah, yeah!"," well, come on, i’ve been saving this money for six years and i kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party."
4596, this is the most special day of our lives.," no, i realize that honey, but i’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party."
4597," honey, umm i-i love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. okay? (laughs) listen, we could always earn more money, okay? but uh, we’re only gonna get married once."," look, i understand, but i have to put my foot down. okay? the answer is no."
4598, you-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?," yes, i am!"
4599," listen umm, i’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that.  eh, you work for that."," look, i thought about it too, and i’m sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
4600, you do?!," yeah, i’m putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do."
4601," oh, you’re so sweet. (they hug and kiss.) oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"," eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y’know? we’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
4602, you thought about that?  how many kids were we gonna have?," uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
4603, what else did you think about?," well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old."
4604," (laughs) y’know what? i-i don’t want a big, fancy wedding.", sure you do.
4605," no, i want everything you just said. i want a marriage.", you sure?  i love you so much.
4606," i love you. (they kiss.) hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right."," oh yeah, totally!"
4607," i don’t want to, i’m scared."," hey, you guys!"
4608," yeah, what?"," are you kidding? okay, i’ll give you a hint; i’ll give you a hint. (points to his glasses.)"
4609," eyes! no, no. your eyes! no. chandler’s eyes!", i got glasses!
4610," well, you-you’ve always had glasses.", no i didn’t!
4611," sweetie, i think the glasses look great. they make you look really sexy."," (sitting down on the arm of her chair) you didn’t think i used to wear glasses, right?"
4612, so what do you guys want for an engagement present?," that’s okay pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so you don’t have to get us…"
4613," hey, i know i what i want!", what we want honey.
4614, you mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that i would never let out of our family?, dying people say the craziest things.
4615, okay. i’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best chocolate chip cookies., our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.
4616, (entering) ahoy!, hey! how’s the boat?!
4617," oh, it’s great! it’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (he says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)"," well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that."
4618, what?! what?! he was trying to cheer me up! my pony was sick.," do you know what i was thinkin’?  nothing, i just like to go like this. (does it again.)"
4619," (entering from the bathrooms) hey chandler, what are you doing tonight?"," uh why, do you have a lecture?"
4620," no, why?", then free as a bird. what’s up?
4621," yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for chancy, i assumed he meant you."," well, did-did you correct him?"
4622," oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.  he hates to lose."," oh no problem, maybe i’ll play with my left hand."
4623, you’re not a lefty?, does anybody know me?!
4624," oh, we have to get you an engagement present?", don’t worry about it pheebs.
4625," okay, here i wish you health and happiness. (she hands monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)", an old cookie?
4626," see no-no, i made a batch and i froze it, and this is the only one left.", we can’t accept this.  ‘cause it’s gross.
4627, no! wait! i think i can figure out the recipe from this cookie! i do stuff like this at work all the time.  yeah! i bet i can do it.," okay, we owe you a present."
4628," well i had a great time! umm, chancy on the other hand…", i will tell the story! it was going great. i let him win. we were bonding. he even said i could call him dad.
4629, and what did he ask you not to call him?," daddy. all right look, here’s the story. (flashback to chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (the flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. he takes off his glasses.) so i take off my glasses and that’s when in happened.  guys?"
4630, oh my god chandler! i can’t believe it!  you gave my father a lap dance!, why do they put so much steam in there?!
4631, ‘cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room., why? okay? why? wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
4632," come on, it’s not that big a deal!", not that big a deal? there…there was touching of things.
4633," listen, i’m sure that dad doesn’t care. he probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!", i don’t want him to tell this story for years.
4634, you were trying to eat it!, if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
4635," (takes the phone from ross) come on. (answering phone) hello? (listens) i’m sorry you have the wrong number. (listens) (whispering) okay, i’ll call you later dad. i love you. (hangs up.)"," (getting up) all right, i’m off to see your dad."
4636," (laughing) yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time."," look, i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and i figure the best way to do that is face to face—and by face i don’t mean his lap. and by face, i don’t mean my ass. (exits.)"
4637, i know! you see it is stuff like this which is why (looking down) you’re burning in hell!!," so you understand, i’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. y’know, i’m a little…i’m a little embarrassed about it."
4638," i understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. as a matter of fact, when i started dating judy i was unemployed, and her father asked me what i did for a living and i told him i was a lawyer.", what did you do when they found out?
4639," they never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. shall we?", so i guess we wear swimsuits in here!
4640," (on phone) hello? (listens) hold on please. joey, it’s your mom. (hands him the phone.)", it’s your mommy. it’s your mommy.
4641, it wasn’t the best., that was one of the worse things ever. and not just on tv.
4642, i don’t know. i don’t know. i can’t lie to him again. oh no i—no! i’m just gonna press my breasts up against him., and say nothing?
4643," okay, hold on just a second. (she grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) i’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it. could you just stand up please?", no-no-no-no. (waves him away as monica and phoebe enter whispering to each other.) hey! (monica shushes him.)
4644, (to chandler) hey sweetie.," hi sweetie. so, what was with all the whispering?"
4645, i can’t tell you. it’s a secret., secret? married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. we have too much love and respect for one another.
4646, awww. (kisses him.) but still no.," no i’m serious, we should tell each other everything. i do not have any secrets from you."
4647," really? okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to ross junior year at disneyland?"," oh no-no, i can’t do that."
4648," if you tell me, i’ll tell you what phoebe said.","so, ross and i are going to disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. and when i say restaurant, i mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. so ross has about 10 tacos. and anyway, we’re on space mountain and ross starts to feel a little iffy."
4649, oh my god. he threw up?," no, he visited a little town south of throw up. (monica laughs hysterically.) so what was phoebe’s secret?"
4650," oh, nancy thompson from phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.", that’s it?! i gave up my disneyland story for that?
4651," chandler, you have an assistant right?", (angrily) did she call? you-you told her i was sick right? always tell her i am sick!
4652," no, i-i just don’t know how you decide who to hire. i mean i’ve got it narrowed down to two people. one of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…", what about him?
4653, okay you’re right. i’ll hire hilda tomorrow. dumb old perfect for the job hilda!, let me see this guy. (phoebe hands him the picture.) w-h-wow! don’t show this to monica! and don’t tell her about the w-h-wow!
4654," hey! good, you’re home!"," oh it’s always nicer to here than, ""aw crap! you again!"""
4655, hey baby. (kisses him.)  i made you a surprise., oh yeah?
4656," yeah, tacos! ever since you told me that story i’ve had such a craving for them.", did you not understand the story?  hey! what’s up?
4657," oh, nothin’ much. just trying to figure out what i’m gonna do for dinner.  (notices the table) hey—ooh! what’s-what’s that, dinner stuff? you making dinner?", no! (the oven dings.) shhh!
4658, (to chandler) you told her!, nancy thompson’s getting fired! (monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
4659, (to chandler) how could you tell her?!, i had too okay?! we’re getting married! married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!
4660, oh really? well i-i guess monica should know about atlantic city., du-ude!
4661," well, chandler and i are in a bar…"," did you not hear me say, ""du-ude?!"""
4662, (to chandler) you kissed a guy?!! oh my god.," in my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy."
4663," oh mon, i laughed so hard…"," ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
4664, why would they do that?! it was a good show right?!," you wanna tell secrets?! okay! okay! in college, ross used to wear leg warmers!"
4665, all right! all right! chandler entered a vanilla ice look-a-like contest and won!, ross came in forth and cried!
4666, it’s hard for some people!, (to monica) of course it is. (mouths to ross) wow—whoa!
4667, chandler one time wore my underwear to work!, hey!!!
4668," ohh! ohh! in college, chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!", that was you!
4669," and in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!", (to monica) you have no trouble telling time now right?  quick! what time is it?! (holds his watch in front of her face.)
4670, i don’t know! time to kiss a guy maybe?! (ross laughs.) what are you laughing at pampers? (he stops laughing and glares at her.), y’know when i said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?  yeah that was stupid. let’s not do that.
4671," man! (monica mouths, ""i’m sorry."")"," yeah, and not that you would, but i wouldn’t hang out with…all the guys in my office."
4672," (pause) yeah, she’s gay.", someone on the subway licked my neck! licked my neck!!
4673, oh willie’s still alive!, what are you guys doing?
4674," oh, my mom called, they’re gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we’re looking for a good picture of us."," oooh, i’m afraid that does not exist."
4675," that’s not true, there are great pictures of us!"," no, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this… (makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. henceforth, this shall be known as the face.)"
4676, oh my god! that’s the creep that you’re with at the statue of liberty.," i don’t know what it is, i just can’t take a good picture."
4677," (looking at one) oh, here’s a great one."," yeah, i’m not in that."
4678, chandler what do you say?," all right, but i should warn you, i’m not going. i’m going. (does the face while saying that last part.)"
4679," (to chandler) dude, that reverse lay-up! oh…", how about those three pointers?
4680, amazing!," and those guys were this (doing the standard ""this close"" gesture) close to lettin’ us play this time too."
4681," oh, you guys call him cute coffeehouse guy, we call him hums while he pees."," yes, and we call ross lingers in the bathroom."
4682," hey, divorced men are not bad men!", they have that on the napkins at the club.
4683," yeah but, my assistant tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. ohh! i could just spread him on a cracker."," rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? i mean y’know you can’t date him right?"
4684, maybe i should open a divorced men’s club., dude that is so sad.
4685, i could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back., could i play?
4686," (taking pictures) great! that’s great monica! great! now, chandler, you want to give us a smile?", okay. (does the face.)
4687," i’m sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?"," no, i am."
4688," chandler, listen to me sweetie, i know you can do this. okay? you have a beautiful smile."," i do? (he smiles, beautifully.)"
4689," yeah! (they turn to the camera, and chandler does the face again.) all right, maybe you don’t have to smile. let’s try something else. let’s try umm, try looking sexy."," okay. (you’ll have to see it, i can’t describe the face he makes, but it isn’t good.)"
4690," i know. let’s try a look…of far off…wonderment. okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come. (chandler is still not getting it.) chandler! what is the matter with your face?! i mean this picture is supposed to say ""geller and bing to be married,"" not ""local woman saves drowning moron!"" (the photographer laughs.) hey! don’t laugh at him! he’s my drowning moron!", aww! (smiles.)
4691," they can’t all be bad. (to chandler) find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. ohh, there it is.", oh my god! those are my bedroom eyes?! why did you ever sleep with me?
4692," see? that’s a great smile! easy. natural. now, pretend i have a camera. (chandler immediately does the face.) you’re changing it!", i can’t help it!
4693," all right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what i do when i take resume shots?", borrow money from me?
4694," okay, first—first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. i look down (looks down), look down, keep looking down; then i look up. (looks up and smiles.) see? all right, now you try. look down (chandler looks down), you’re looking down, keep looking down…", why is there jelly on your shoe?
4695," hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. y’know, that’s why i never had any luck with chandler.", (pause) i’m right here!
4696," hey! no-no-no-no, you can’t take him away from me! i got a great partner to pick up girls with! finally!!", i’m still right here!
4697," i know, monica told me."," did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?"
4698, yeah. sure. (joey nods his head questioningly and rachel nods no.), can you people not see me?! (he waves his arms around to get their attention.)
4699, (seeing him approach) hey! there you are!," there i am!  yeah, joey said i uh, i needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.  yeah, and then i fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to brooklyn. brooklyn is f-far!!"

4707," dude, you didn’t say die hard. is everything okay?"," yeah, i just got uh, got plans."
4708," well, john mclane had plans!"," no, see the thing is i want to get out of here before joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch."
4709," yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey i was at brunch. this woman overheard that i was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.", that’s sweet.
4710," no, it’s more like a (sarcastically) good luck."," so uh, what did this woman look like?"
4711,"she was like 30, dark hair, attractive."," well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?"
4712," come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?"," no, no i only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive… (thinks a little while.) hold on one second; let me check this out. (he gets up and grabs a photo album.  well, let’s see… (finding the picture he wants.) okay uh, is that her? (pointing to the picture.)"
4713, oh my god yes! who is she?," julie grath, my camp girlfriend."
4714, did you break up with her?," (pause) no, we’re still together. yeah we went out for two summers, and then i broke up with her.  well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…"
4715, fat?!," i did not say fat! i said, ""fa-aa-aw-ow…"""
4716, you broke up with a girl because she was fat?!," yeah. yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! does she still feel bad?"
4717," well, apparently she does."," well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (monica is not amused by that statement.) seriously, good luck marrying me."
4718, chandler! (knocks on the door.) chandler! i just figured out who you are!, can you figure out what i’m doing?
4719," you’re lewis posin.  lewis posin! he was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. do you know why?", because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
4720," no! but because he thought i was to faaaaa…. (chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) and every time i think about it, it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade! y’know, i-i really think that you should apologize to julie.",what? are you kidding? that was like 16 years ago.
4721," no, i know. but y’know what? it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me."," okay, i will do it. but i have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!"
4722, and she’s back in the game.," (she opens the door) julie hi! chandler bing, i, i guess you remember me."
4723, hello skidmark.," (to monica) it’s a nickname, i’ll explain later."
4724, it’s pretty clear.," ah, uh, i owe you a long overdue apology. i never should have broken up with you because you were overweight."
4725, that’s why you broke up with me?," you-you-you didn’t know that. (pause as she nods no.) well, i guess my work here is done!"
4726," no reason, i’m just saying that uh… that’s where i’ll be.", as bad as that went i actually enjoyed myself. i think that i’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do.
4727, why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? then you wouldn’t have to apologize., i would really love it if could do both.
4728," all right, i…i have to ask.  are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again?  well, you broke up with julie grath! how much weight could she have gained?", a hundred and forty-five pounds.
4729, in one year?! my god what did she eat? her-her family! that’s not the point.,"look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but i was 15!"
4730," well… that’s not the only time this was an issue. you remember when umm, you spent thanksgiving with us? you called me fat."," okay. okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.  you were not supposed to hear that! i said that behind you back!"
4731," what if i have babies, okay? i mean i’m gonna look different. i’m okay with that, but i’m not sure that you are!"," look you have to realize i don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (monica glares at him.) see this is one of things that i can apologize for later! look, what i mean is you’re monica! okay? and i am in love with monica."
4732, keep going., so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you.
4733, even if i shrink down to two inches tall?, i’d carry you around in my pocket.
4734, i love you. (they hug and kiss.), skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.
4735, (pause) would you like some pancakes?, …come on! why are we here?!
4736," okay, okay take a guess.", the hot chicks?
4737," okay, okay, i was typing names into the library computer earlier, y’know-y’know for fun, and i typed mine in and guess what came up? my doctoral dissertation! it’s here! yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! in the biggest library in the university! (they start heading that way, towards a secluded section behind the racks.)", wow that’s actually pretty cool.
4738," (stopping quickly) oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named wendy bagina. (they both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.) what is that?", sounds like two people are really enjoying the dewey decimal system.
4739, sorry!," you didn’t bring me here to do that, did you?"
4740," so, who’s the lucky guy?"," oh…my…gawd! i am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? you didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?"
4741," well, she saw the ring.", did she freak out?
4742," well, she was shocked when i told her, but then again so were most people.  well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named clark. uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. clark too.", (laughs) you said no right?  you said no right?!
4743," well, she corned me! she asked if the wedding was in town! i mean, what was i supposed to do?!", lie!!! how hard is that?! the check’s in the mail! oh your baby is so cute! i can’t wait to read your book ross!!
4744, come on! so she comes to the wedding! i mean it won’t be so bad., what do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? you don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? you don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing part-time lover?!
4745," oh my god, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!", y’know what? it’s gonna be okay. y’know what? she’s probably not gonna even want to come.  no! that was a lie! see how easy that was?
4746, so-so you would’ve just lied?  would it really have been that easy?, yes!!!
4747," oh, what are you, stupid? it’s been three hours.  i should just go on to happier things, okay? umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?"," well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. uh, tiny! we’re not even sure why we’re having it."
4748, what are we gonna do?, i say we go with careless whisper.  (to monica) did she see us yet? did she see us?
4749," please, it’s because otherwise i really don’t know what i might do.", aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?
4750, we’ll just…we’ll just let her stay.," no-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!"
4751, kinda like your barca lounger., is that what you’re thinking about right now?
4752," hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before i take my bath."," janice, i’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight."
4753, he does?, say again?
4754, that’s right. that’s right. and that is why you can’t stay here tonight. and probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.," feelings, such strong feelings."
4755," (to the guard) don’t sweat it, i’ve got this section covered. yeah, in fact i’ve got this little baby (turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in people’s eye—(the guard walks away)—okay, see you later.", i just wanted to show monica your book. (ross just glares at him.)
4756, (entering) hey everybody! happy thanksgiving!," no, no, no. no-no-no."
4757," what, are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year?"," no, we're playing this game i learned at work. you have to name all the states in six minutes."
4758, what? that's like insanely easy!," now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. you always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to monica)."
4759," nobody cares about the dakotas. (that’s true in so many ways, trust me, i’ve lived in one and been to the other.)"," oh, okay, time's up!"
4760,"all right, i got 48."," oh that's not bad, pheebs?"
4761," oh, i got tired of naming states. so i decided to list the types of celery, and i have one: regular celery.","okay, so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, joey?"
4762, fifty-six!  hey! how is new england not a state? huh? they have a sports-team!, does south oregon have a sports-team? (joey strikes one from his list) there you go.
4763, done! with time a-to-spare., oooh that may be a new world's record (looks at his watch and picks up ross' pad)
4764," you know, i hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and joey can't name all the states. did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" hmm?","uh, magellan? you got 46 states. (smiles and hands ross back his pad)"
4765," all right, i'm out of oven space. i'm gonna turn on joey's. please, watch him! do not let joey eat any of the food!"," i am only one man! (monica heads out) okay ross, time is up!"
4766," no, just give me another minute."," look ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? that is the beauty of this game. it makes you want to kill yourself."
4767,"this-this is crazy! i can do this! all right, uhh, i bet i can get all 50 before dinner."," okay, but if you can't…no dinner!"
4768, chandler? can you give me a hand? (grabs her jacket)," sure, and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment."
4769, ross’s apartment is nice! how come we don't hang out here more often?, i don't know. maybe it's because it smells a little weird. it's like old pumpkins or something.
4770, that's my pie!, which smells delicious!
4771," phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!"," tell her, i'm allergic, and i will sue!"
4772, ohio!! thank you!, huh! where is the dog?!
4773, there's no dog in here.," phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!"
4774," no that's just me coughing! (doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. phoebe comes out of the room.) oh, good, there you are! listen, um, i have a dog in my room.", what is it doing here?
4775," oooh, i wish she could stay here, but chandler is allergic!","extremely allergic, okay? if i'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!"
4776,"that's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days", (gasping) really?
4777," chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?"," well, it still has to go, right?"
4778, don't do what?," (to joey) i have to! okay? it's time! (joey shrugs as if to say, ""do what you have to do"") okay, i hate dogs."
4779, told ya. (waves bye-bye.)," they are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit."
4780," wait a minute. do you not like all dogs? i mean, not even puppies?", (scared) is there a puppy here?
4781, you don't like puppies?," (to tag) okay, you are new!"
4782, it's too cold.," okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable."
4783, (to phoebe) it hurts my teeth.," and i don't wanna say this, i don't you guys to hate me, but uh, i don't think, i can be around that dog anymore. okay, so either the dog goes, or i go. (an awkward silence ensues.) oh my god!!"
4784, where's chandler?, (comes out of the bathroom) here i am.
4785, wash your hands!!!, how did you…know? (heads back into the bathroom)
4786," see, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (she rushes into her room)", (comes out of the bathroom) where's monica?
4787," um, in phoebe's room. you can't go in there.  monica's crying. she's very upset about this whole clunkers thing."," well, i, i should go in there."
4788," no. no, no. she doesn't want to see you right now.  because you sent away the dog!", this is ridiculous. (he heads for phoebe's bedroom)
4789," (entering) okay, i'm in my sweat pants. bring on the food! (sees that chandler has a worried look on his face) what's the matter?"," monica's all upset, because i sent clunkers away."
4790," so? bring the dog back, you're a hero."," yeah, i can be a hero, i could do that. i could, i could do... i, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?"
4791," chandler, it's like a big gerbil.", and that doesn't scare you? (he walks out)
4792," (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) hey, is chandler here?"," no, no he went for a walk."
4793," (interrupts her, to monica) shh, wait and see. maybe we will, maybe we won't."," okay, i went over to ross' apartment to bring back clunkers. y’know, for you, and…(clears his throat) i left the door open and she must have gotten out and i looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which fyi ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. i couldn't find him, and i am so, so, so, sorry. but i do know where we could all go ease the pain. (points up and then over to the street)"
4794, (uncovers the dog) hi!, clunkers?! oh my god!
4795, it's a thanksgiving miracle!, (to clunkers) it is so good to see you!
4796,"okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. let me tell you something, i have 49 states, and there are no more! i-i think, i should be able to eat something.", it's up to you.
4797, delaware! (starting to cry.) delaware!  (hands chandler his pad and walks in) i want my turkey now!," you got it. (starts looking at the pad, while ross got the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) you got nevada twice."
4798, (pauses) i know., yeah. (throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
4799, uh-huh!," okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (does so.)"
4800," no-no, one daddy, two mommies. all right, it’s all yours. (ross pushes him off.)", okay. okay.
4801," well, we didn’t have a lot of money. but the girl across the street had the best bike! it was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.", that sounds like my first bike. (they all turn and look at him.) my dad gave me his old one.
4802," not really, i got to drag him around too! (they all nod, ""oh."")", hey! what are you guys doing?
4803, making holiday candy for the neighbors.," i’m sorry, who?"
4804, i’m gonna hang this basket (points to the one sitting on the table) on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece., but we don’t know the neighbors.
4805, see? this is exactly why i’m making this candy. we can learn their names and get to know our neighbors., wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?
4806," (entering, happily) gooood morning!!"," eh, somebody’s in a good mood!"
4807," the basket is totally empty! my god, the neighbors ate all the candy!"," well, either that or uh…(motions towards joey’s door.)"
4808," (starts to leave, but stops) oh and chandler’s about to cry.", (about to cry) am not!
4809, (turning a light on) who is that?!," don’t worry, i’m brave! i am brave! i…i am brave! (they get to the door and monica goes to open it.) no-no-no-no!! (he stops her.) (through the door.) can you tell me who is there please?"
4810, oh please! (to chandler) did you hear that? little drops of heaven.,(laughs) 4:00 a.m.
4811," so, can i get some candy?"," i am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (monica looks at him) (to monica) he does not know that i am not some of us."
4812," well okay, i’ll swing by later. do you live in this building?  (looking at monica.) mm! seems like i would’ve remembered you!", mm! night gar’! (monica closes the door.)
4813, almost cried huh? hear that chandler? almost cried!," hey, you cry every time somebody talks about titanic!"
4814, oh hi!, hey! so are you enjoying the bike?
4815," see, this is why i told you never get involved with your assistant! and here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (to chandler) did you hear that chandler? no such thing!", (with his mouth full) what happened? i’m just eating candy.
4816," maybe it’s not as bad as i think. y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way i meant it."," absolutely! y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker."
4817, oh my god! joey!, what is the matter with you?
4818," (watching the discussion) hey chandler, do we know that lady?"," maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?"
4819, (closing the door) it’s unbelievable! i-i can’t believe that sign didn’t work!, y’know what would work?  stop making candy!
4820, but they like it!, you mean they like you.
4821, maybe., is that why you became a chef? so that people would like you?
4822, (looking at his butt) there it is. (they hug.), (asking a man leaning against the wall) what is going on?
4823, yeah lady! give us candy!!, joey!
4824, what’s up buddy?  waiting for candy.," get in here! (they head for the door and chandler sees smokes-a-lot lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) hey, and you can not smoke in here! (takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (exhaling in ecstasy) merry christmas."
4825, we want candy! we want candy now! (and other general commotion sounds.)," all right everybody! just be quiet! be quiet! be quiet!! pipe-pipe-pipe down! (they settle down) what is the matter with you people?! this woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. she was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and i’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! am i right?"
4826, (from earlier) candy lady?, no not (imitating) candy lady.
4827," (stepping in and knocking the man over) hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!"," all right, y’know what? forget it, all of you forget it! you’ve ruined it! go home! you’ve ruined it! you’ve ruined it!"
4828, (to chandler) thank you., you’re welcome. (they kiss.)
4829, did you smoke?, no! smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. eh-uh—are you okay?
4830," don’t be so corny ross, it’s not an after-school special. (she rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly attached.)", buh-bye. (hangs up the phone) i just got us reservations at michelle’s and tickets to the musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
4831, betrothed… (corrects him), …betrothed couple.
4832, haaaa... (puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!, pheebs?  skull?
4833, (to monica) did you know he was in there?, how long have we been home?
4834, about a half an hour.," lovely!  hey, you know what i was thinking? when we get married, are you gonna change your last name to bing?"
4835," yes, you will be very sad. all right, well i gotta go tell rachel the good news.", ohh! you guys gonna be living together again?
4836," yeah, why not?"," well, she's just so much fun with joey, i just assumed, she'd still be living with him."
4837," why do you think, she's having so much fun living with joey?"," no reason, except…she…told…me."
4838," really? so she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?"," no! no, she didn't say that. i-i-i think you should talk to monica now."
4839," probably? yeah, i don't like that word. (chandler and monica look surprised) kind of what ‘probably’ really means. yeah, uh-huh. yeah, oh, ""your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y’know? i'm sorry, but i'm not hanging all my hopes of rachel and i living together on-on ""probably!"" y’know? you gotta take care of yourselves! (she starts to walk out) in this world history teaches us nothing! (exits)"," bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?"
4840, (yelling) no! drums!," (to the maitre d') hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? (laughs.)"
4841,"oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.",forty-five minutes? we have tickets to the musicman at 8:00.
4842," i'm sorry. christmas is a very busy time, sir.", is this because of the burrito thing?
4843, (pulling chandler away from the maitre d') you need to give him money., give him money? it was a joke!
4844," no, to get a table! places like are always shakin’ you down. everybody wants to be paid off."," right, calm down, o'mally. i'll slip him some money."
4845, you've got to be smooth about it.," hey, i can be smooth. (walks back to the maitre d', very smoothly) listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, i'd appreciate it. (shakes his hand)"
4846," of course, sir.", okay. (walks back to monica)
4847, how did it go?, had the money in the wrong hand. (shows her his left hand with the money in it)
4848," it's easy! just keep it casual! give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!"," how do you know so much about this?  richard used to do it, didn't he?"
4849, we'd be eating our soup right now., mustached bastard…
4850," (sees two people exit) okay, those people just left, come on! quick! give him the money and get their table!", (walks up to the maitre d') excuse me...
4851, (to the maitre d') good evening. (shakes his hand)," (finds his money) ahh-hahaha! (turns around to give the maitre d' his money, but he isn't there anymore)"
4852, that's fun. (she exits disappointedly.)," thank you gunther, put it there. (he gets up, and shakes gunther's hand. a bunch of coins fall out his hand. he sits down next to monica.) definitely not easier with coins. (joey gets up and picks up the coins. chandler thinks, joey is just helping him to pick them up.) thank you."
4853, thank you. (he gets up and puts on his jacket.) (phoebe enters) hey pheebs! here. (gives her the coins) now i only owe you $49.50., hey pheebs!
4854, hey! (she sits down next to him)," if you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?"
4855, years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees...," (entering in a santa costume) ho, ho, ho! merry christmas!"
4856, santa! (runs to chandler and hugs him), hey! (grunts as ben hits him at full speed.)
4857," what are you doing here, santa?"," well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?"
4858," did you bring me any presents, santa?"," you bet i did, ben, put it there! (he shakes ben's hand, but the money falls out of his hands) (to monica) well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! (realizes, that ben is standing right there) ho, ho, ho!"
4859, (to chandler) what are you doing?," you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!"
4860," thank you, but, but you gotta leave.  because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it.", but i didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
4861," i'm sorry, chandler but this, this is really important to me."," fine, i'll give the suit back."
4862," (to chandler) hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (she has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling chandler's beard.)", santa? really?
4863," yes, is that okay?", did your dad ever dress up like santa?  then it's okay! (they kiss.)
4864, no! why does he have to go?," because, if santa and the holiday…armadillo? (ross nods) ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. merry christmas!"
4865," fine, i-i give up. santa, santa can stay."," well, i'll stay, but only because i wanna hear about hanukkah. ben, will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah?"
4866, awesome!," okay, i guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time."
4867," joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!", ohh. mmm.
4868, (comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) hi.," hey, you have got to try this cheesecake."
4869," oh, y’know i'm not that much of a sweet tooth. i—(chandler puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)—wow. my god, so creamy. oh my god, this is the best cheesecake i have ever had. where did you get this? (she reaches over to look at the label on the box.)", (nervously) it was at the front door. when i got home. somebody sent it to us.
4870," chandler, this is not addressed to you. this is addressed to mrs. braverman downstairs. (gasping) thief.", i—no! i didn't read the box before i opened it. and you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
4871," why, why not?", because it's too delicious.
4872," chandler, you stole this cheesecake. that is wrong."," no-no-no! it is going to be okay, because mrs. braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, (reading the label) momma’s little bakery. (pause) i feel terrible, i’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person."
4873," all right, i should get going, big day a work. y’know i’m in a coma? today, they do this test on me and it turns out i’m not brain dead.", so…
4874, okay. (joey exits.),"oh, what’s at 8:00?"
4875," you were invited?! my god, i can’t believe this! i mean i knew that mom and dad were invited, but i thought that was it! i mean from the ages 7 to 9 frannie and i were inseparable!","well, maybe since the age of 9, frannie’s made some new friends."
4876," y’know, she tried to undress me too.", i used to undress my cousin glenn. (monica looks at him then sushes him.)
4877, the ross—is that back?!! (chandler motions no.), another cheesecake came! they delivered it to the wrong address again!
4878," so just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?", i can’t seem to say goodbye.
4879," are you serious?! chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?", well i’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
4880," it was cheesecake. it was fine. it had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling… (pause) wow! my whole mouth just filled with saliva!", (closing the box) y’know what? forget it! we are just hungry! we have not had lunch! we are just light-headed! so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
4881, yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted., good idea. where do you want to go to lunch?
4882, (laughs) we’ll see.," well, thank you for lunch."
4883," what? wait a minute, i didn’t pay, i thought you paid!", so apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore. (rachel laughs then chandler notices something.) do you see what i see?
4884, (gasps) its still there! (the cheesecake they returned to mrs. braverman is still lying in front of her door.), mrs. braverman must be out. (they move closer to it.)
4885, she could be out of town. maybe she’ll be gone for months.," by then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. we don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake."
4886, no that could kill her.," well, we don’t want that."
4887, no so we’re protecting her., but we should take it.
4888, but we should move quick.  because i think i just heard her moving around in there., go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! (rachel grabs the cheesecake and they take off upstairs.)
4889, (taking a bite) oh my god! that is so good!," i’m full, and yet i know if i stop eating this, i’ll regret it."
4890," oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. do you want some? (he makes a disgusted noise and heads for his room, chandler follows him in.)", what are you doing tonight?
4891, huh? uh… (he starts taking off his pants.), dude! dude! (motions that joey should pull up his pants.)
4892," oh! (pulls up his pants.) sorry. uh, i’ve got those plans with phoebe, why?","oh really? uh, monica said she had a date at 9:00."
4893, what?! tonight?!, that’s what monica said.
4894," oh, you’re such a gentleman. (grabs his arm.) come on! we’re going to my place! (drags him off to her place.)", are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
4895, (with a mouthful) mm-mmm. (nods no.), i will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (she tries to whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) how can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
4896," oh, what are you going to do?! are you gonna go run tell monica?! are you gonna tell joey?! no! because then you will have to tell them what we did! we are desert stealers! we are living outside the law!"," y’know what? i don’t trust you with this cake anymore! and i got it first, and i’m takin’ it back! (grabs the cheesecake and heads for his apartment.)"
4897," what?! what?!  wait a minute!  oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don’t!", oh yes! oh yes!
4898, you think i trust you with it?! no! we’re gonna split it! you take half and i take half!," well that’s not fair, you’ve already had some!"
4899," what? oh, well then y’know what? i think monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.", what do we use to split it?
4900," okay! (grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) all right, pick a half."," (examining the cake) okay well, this side looks bigger. uh… there’s more crust on this side. y’know? so, maybe if i measured…"
4901, oh for god sake just pick a piece!," all right, i’ll pick that one. (points.)"
4902," that’s also the smaller piece. (puts the piece onto a plate.) okay, there you go. enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. no sharing. no switching, and don’t come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. (as she’s saying that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her place, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) oh!!!!", (gloatingly and holding his piece) ohhh!
4903," okay, you gotta give me some of your piece."," oh-ho-ho-ho-no! no! no switching! no sharing, and don’t come crying to me! ha-ha-ha! i may just sit here and have my cake all day! just sit here in the hallway and eat my… (rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor. that process leaves just the forkful chandler has, rachel starts to go after that little bit and chandler retreats into his apartment.)"
4904, oh! yay! look! there’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!, stick to your side!
4905," (looking up) there it is! oh, look at that! isn’t mother nature amazing?", (looking up with her) that’s a plane!
4906," okay, we’ve been out here for two hours and we haven’t seen any stupid comets. can we go now? i mean, chandler’s getting chilly. (she walks over to where chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)"," (with a quivering voice) no, i’m not!"
4907, then why are you wearing monica’s jacket?, because it’s flattering! (shivers harder) come on monica! come on monica! (he goes inside.)
4908, (covering his ears and yelling) oh no! no! no! (he starts banging on the door.), (whispering) monica!
4909, she’s sleeping.," i know, just quick-quick question, quick question. which one was deep impact and which one was armageddon?"
4910," deep impact was the one with robert duval, armageddon is what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up."," sorry, i just…can’t sleep. ooh! (turns on the light and monica groans.) where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? because every time i look at that cover i’m like…(fake snores.)"
4911, it is in the living room where there is also a light! and no one will kick you in the shin., what?! (monica kicks him in the shin.) ow! (he gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)
4912," (to joey) i know, i wasn’t finished. (joey motions him to finish.) (yelling at the street) but don’t worry! we’re gonna go down the fire escape!!"," shhhhhhhhh!!! (monica enters) i’m sorry, i thought maybe i’d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep."
4913, with a wok? (chandler’s holding a wok.) i thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep., it got interesting! damn you oprah!
4914," here, let me make the milk, i’m up anyway."," hey, y’know what we can do? y’know, now that we are up? we can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were first going out. it’d be fun!"
4915, okay that does sound like fun.," okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?"
4916, the second sister dies?!," (pause) no. no, i-i was, i was talking about the book i was reading."
4917, the second sister dies in archie and jughead double digest?, that’s correct.
4918," okay, here’s your milk. what do you want to talk about? (she sees that chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)", (startled) what? what? what?
4919, are you still awake?, yeah! you?
4920," you do know that was me who just said that right? (he doesn’t respond and she turns on the light, waking him.) hey. as long as we’re both up…", (intrigued) yeah? (monica nods yes.) i hope you’re not thinking about cleaning the living room.
4921, what?! what are you doing?!, do you know what just happened?
4922, yeah. we-we had sex and then we fell asleep., no. we were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.
4923," nooo! no, that’s not true. no, best time ever! yeah, you rocked me world! (she turns out the light to go back to sleep.)"," (turning the light back on) monica?  i was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. so please wake up so we can do it right!"
4924," okay. okay, i’m ready. come on big fella!  give me the good stuff."," yeah! (monica falls asleep) no! no! no! don’t fall asleep! okay, i am going to make you some coffee. (monica doesn’t move as he gets out of bed and as he’s heading for the door.) and i probably won’t spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor."
4925, that really was some of your best work.," hm-hmm, i told you! (looks at the clock) i can’t believe that i’ve only got two hours before i call in sick for work."
4926, i have to be up in seven minutes.," well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes…  do you wanna?"
4927," hey, y’know what’s weird? after you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, ""this is my brother-in-law ross."" not, ""my friend ross,"" ""brother-in-law ross."" that’s weird isn’t it?"," couldn’t i just say, ""this is ross?"""
4928," (on phone) uh, hello dad! monica and i just saw the house in the paper! (listens) yes we’re surprised! (listens) who did you leave a message with?", (knocking on the window while outside) sorry! (runs off.)
4929," no. (pause) oh wait yes! i do, i do have one question. what is toner?"," joey! joe! (sees that he’s not here and starts investigating. he picks up the bag of chips.) full bag. (he picks up the beer.) beer’s still cold. something terrible must’ve happened here! (he decides it’s not that important; sits down on rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (runs over to stevie.) stevie, i was never here! (runs out.)"
4930," oh yeah? i work in a cubicle surrounded by people. i’ve been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one’s even looked up from their desk. hang-hang on. (to the people standing around his cubicle.) hey everybody! uh, i’m gonna kill myself! (there’s no response; no one even looks up.) i’ll get back to ya. (to phoebe) i got nothing. wait. (he sets the phone down.) uh, hey marge! (mimes putting a gun to his head, pulling the trigger, and splattering his brain on the wall behind him. then points to himself. marge watches this, then goes back to work.) (to phoebe) ehh, nothing. nothing."," my chair. now, if anybody asks, your name is rosita! (he runs out the door, grabs the back of rosita, and we can hear joey and rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. neither of them have reached the landing yet.)"
4931," hey chandler!  how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?"," yeah, i’d love to but i’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore."
4932," well what if i told you, you can do it in my apartment?", (excitedly) are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year?
4933,"i just purchased the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000. (which is an actual product by the way, i’m not sure about the 3000 part.)", that’s awesome! that’s great! what made you do it?!
4934," well, it’s a long story, but umm i broke joey’s chair…", whoa-whoa-whoa! you broke joey’s chair?  i thought i broke joey’s chair! that’s why i replaced it with mine!
4935, ohhhhh. that’s how it got fixed!," well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?"
4936, noo! (laughs) angels., i’m gettin’ my chair back! (heads for joey and rachel’s.)
4937," well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! yeah! so, i guess this chair is mine now! (sits down in it and groans.)", joey you broke my chair!!
4938," uh-huh! nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! all right? that is my chair now! you can sit on my lap! (joey starts to get up.) no i take that back!", i think i should get the chair!
4939, how do you figure?," because you (points to joey) broke a chair and you (points to rachel) broke a chair! the only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair, is me!"
4940, no-no-no! this chair’s not going anywhere.," well, where’s the logic in that?!"
4941," the logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!", so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing!
4942, that’s right!, what are you guys? like a gang or something?!
4943, late thirties? oh come on you guys! is it just me? am i overreacting to this?," no rach, it’s not just you. my thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun."
4944," hey! that was a practical purchase! i needed that car for transportation! okay? i-i have a child!  how hot do i look in this, huh?!"," ross, a sports car? wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?"
4945, weren’t you asked to leave sonny?, (to joey) would you put that back on?! monica’s gonna be here any minute!
4946, but it hurt’s my joey’s apple.," (frustrated) okay, for the last time. it’s not named for each individual man."
4947, (to chandler) you’ve done a wonderful job with this party chandler. everything looks so lovely.," oh well, not as lovely as you. i mean, i can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (to mr. geller) and you! i can’t believe that you would have a tux that’s thirty years old! (puts his hand on mr. geller’s shoulder.)"
4948, it’s older than that. ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo., ohh! (he quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
4949, (entering) hey! everybody hide! hide! i saw her! she’s coming!," okay! okay! everybody down! everybody down! (rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. as everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)"
4950, crap.," (getting up to investigate) okay, everybody stay here. i will find out what’s going on."
4951, heyyy!! you got the door open!! (giggles.), hey-hey are you drunk?
4952," nooo! (giggles) okay. (she tries to pull herself up by rachel and joey’s doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment. she manages to catch herself.) whoa! (stands up, unsteadily) okay. see i was, i was a little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (giggles.) so the bus boys took me out for some drinks. (pause) i wanna puke on you later!"," okay, here is the thing. we have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! all of your friends are in there and your parents!"
4953, noo!!!  noo!!  oh no! my parents have never seen me drunk! (pause) that they know of.," okay, here’s the thing. we’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re drunk."
4954, really?! you promise?," yeah, i’ll take care of it."
4955, okay. i love you so much. (kisses him.), (laughing) okay we have to do something about your breath.
4956, what about your breath?! (breathes on him.)," that’s still yours. okay, now remember it’s a surprise party. so, when you go in, act surprised."
4957," right, okay, then no."," okay before we start the celebration, monica has to go put on her party dress.  see? (does his laugh.) here we go. (starts walking her to their room, and has to pass in front of mr. geller who’s sitting at the table and mrs. geller who’s standing next to him.)"
4958, (sees someone) paul!, (correcting her) phil.
4959, phil!," now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (monica stumbles on the steps.) okay, (catches her) you’re doing great. you’re doing great. you’re doing fine."
4960," hey, what’s going on?", monica’s a little drunk.
4961, awwwww… (giggles.), (to monica) go change! (to phoebe) she doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.
4962, what’s-what’s going on? phil’s really pissed!, monica’s wasted.
4963, maybe that will liven up this party.," (to rachel) okay, will you just go help her change please!"
4964," no! no-no, i love it. thank you. (kisses him.)"," okay, open ours next. open ours next!"
4965," now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys?"," for my last birthday you gave me a hug! (to rachel) okay, read the card! read the card!"
4966," okay. (opens the card and reads it.) happy birthday grandma! it’s better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (breaks down as everyone glares at them.) all our love monica and chandler. (crying) that’s funny, yeah!", no-no-no-no! that was the joke!
4967," (crying) no, i know! i get it! it’s funny!"," no, because you’re not a grandmother!"
4968, (to monica) you’re drunk! mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! maybe i’m a little drunk., (to a waiter) oh that’s great! right there! can we get some of that over here please? (the waiter comes over) there we go.
4969, (to the waiter) hey! are those crab cakes? (the waiter nods) did i not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?, (to monica) how are you feeling?
4970, i really wish that you wouldn’t.," (to monica) now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? then we can put you in bed, okay? just smile and don’t talk to anyone."
4971, (clinking two glasses together) speech! speech! let’s hear from the birthday girl! huh?, pheebs!!
4972," oh-ho, i think it’s nice.", i think it’s necessary. (backs away anyhow.)
4973, (interrupting her) lift!! and slide!," okay, here we go."
4974," yeah, i’m sorry. (they hug.)", hey! how’d it go?
4975," (entering, limping, and holding his arm) i don’t like this anymore. (he sits down with them in pain.)"," well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds."
4976," yeah, it’s just y’know…", (to ross) monica said wedding.
4977, oh! i would love to read a poem., do you think you could get through a poem?
4978," okay. yeah, i guess, i guess i could do that too.", too?
4979," sorry, i’m kinda keeping this one on the q.t."," well, whatever it is, i hope it involves winking. (winks in a spy-type manner.)"
4980," and-and-and not only that, i’m gettin’ a new brain!!", so great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
4981, and the way she slaps all the time!  wouldn’t you love to do it just once?! (raises her hand towards chandler.), don’t do it.
4982, (showing phoebe her phone) his new girlfriend!, i think it’s the dying cat parade.
4983, it sounds like it’s coming from across the street.," (turning around and looking) oh my god!  y’know that thing that ross was gonna do at our wedding?! he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""you’re half scottish right?"""
4984," nooo!!  no, there is no way! it can not be ross! (she looks through the window and sees ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) unbelievable! why is your family scottish?!", why is your family ross?!
4985," he cannot play at our wedding! i mean everyone will leave! i mean come on, that is just noise! it’s not even a song!"," if you listen very carefully, i think its celebration by cool and the gang."
4986, (shocked) i can do an english accent?! that baby’s going on my resume!," well, i feel like a snack!"
4987, do you want some shortbread? eh that’s scottish like you are.," oh no thanks. i don’t like any thing from my scottish heritage.  well it’s just my entire family was run out of scotland by…vikings. anyway, lots of bad memories. (makes a few unintelligible noises.)"
4988, how did you know about that?!, we heard you play all the way from your apartment!
4989, were you the ones called the cops?!," that’s not really important right now. what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.  because we hate them."
4990, come on that’s not fair! i mean you haven’t even heard me play!, we have heard you play.
4991, what about the second minister we meet with? i kinda liked him., you mean the spitter?
4992, come on! it wasn’t that bad!, easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.
4993," all right, what about the third guy?", you mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
4994, can you blame him?," sorry, i just don’t like the idea of when i say, ""i do,"" he’s thinking, ""yeah, i’d do her too!"""
4995, what?! no! it was my idea!, guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
4996, does calling it not mean anything anymore?!," we are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! and when i say legitimate i mean, gay and in control of his saliva!"
4997," so, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?"," no, but horny for monica minister called, wanting to know if we were still together."
4998, well then let me do it!, joe…
4999," yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. it’ll be me! and i swear i’ll do a really good job. plus, y’know i love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me."," (to monica) y’know, we haven’t found anybody else."
5000, so i can do it?, yeah you can do it.
5001," yeah, i just got off the internet! man, there is a lot of porn out there!", our minister…
5002," anyway, i started working on what i’m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?  now-now, listen this is just a first draft so… (starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) ""we are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that monica and chandler share."" (monica and chandler like it so far.) eh? (he continues reading.) ""it is a love based on giving and receiving. as well as having and sharing. and the love that they give and have is shared and received. and through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."" (phoebe nods her approval.) ""we too can share and love and have and receive.""", (to monica) should we call the spitter?
5003," okay you guys, i got a little more written. are you ready?", yeah. o-okay.
5004, how about receiving?," see joe, not that that’s not grrreat! but, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! y’know, it can be more personal. you can tell stories about us!"
5005," ooh, like the time you and i went to atlantic city and i made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! remember?"," no, not us… (motions joey and him.) us! (motions monica and him.)"
5006, oh! suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!," see joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. nice stories."
5007," ""…by doin’ it.""  okay. all right. umm, so uh, so how did it happen? did your eyes meet across the room? and then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and she’s feeding you strawberries?", isn’t that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?
5008, yeah baby!, and i was a perfect gentleman and i walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.  but then later that night…  (answering the door) hey!
5009, (standing outside) cute pj’s! you’re really livin’ it up here in london huh?,well i was… i was exactly expecting company after…(he looks at his watch.) 9:15.
5010, (entering) is joey here?," well, last time i saw him he was heading out the door with the bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. so uh, you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?"
5011, wouldn’t you be?," well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, and you’ve had a lot to drink. and you’ve just got to let that go okay? i mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!  you kidding? you’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms… (she jumps up and kisses him.) (breaking the kiss.) whoa! whoa! whoa! what’s going on? you and i just made out! you and i are making out?"
5012," well, not anymore.", but we don’t do that.
5013," i know, i just thought it would be fun.", how drunk are you?
5014, drunk enough to know that i want to do this. not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage., (thinks) that’s the perfect amount!
5015, (breaking the kiss) y’know what’s weird?  this doesn’t feel weird!  you’re a really good kisser.," well, i have kissed over four women. (they kiss again.) do you wanna get under the covers?"
5016, hm-hmm!  wow! you are really fast!, it bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
5017, we’re gonna see each other naked., yep!
5018, do you wanna do it at the same time?, count of three?
5019, one!, two!
5020," three! (they lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)", well i think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
5021," eh, we weren’t that close anyway!", eh!  joey! joey! joey! j-j-joey-joey-j-joey! (monica hides under the covers as joey enters. remember?)  hey joe! i was just watching a movie-e-e… (notices that the tv is turned off.)
5022," oh, dude i’m so sorry!", no! no! no!
5023," hey no-no-no-no! it’s cool! it’s cool! i-i’ll only be a second, i’m still with my bride’s maid, i just—where are those condoms you brought?", they’re in my bag over there. (points.)
5024, ah. (joey walks to chandler’s bag by getting as far away from chandler’s bed as possible.)," uh, could you leave me one?"
5025," (pause) for just you?  hey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? there’s some really nice girls down there.", no i-i-i’m fine.
5026," yeah, it’s totally meant to be. (to monica) tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.  (to joey) what?!", who did you originally want to hook up with?
5027, yeah baby! (chandler glares at him.) no baby!, (to monica) so you came to the room looking for joey? did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
5028, no because it-it didn’t seem important.," oh, it’s not important? it’s not important?! if it wasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him (points to joey) not me!"
5029, and it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—(shuts up on monica’s glare.), i don’t believe it. the most romantic night of my life and i’m runner up.
5030," hey! (monica turns and looks at him) now i’m a man of the cloth, but i still have feelings!", (to joey) look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now. okay?
5031," what?! that’s not fair! it’s not my fault! i was off with my bride’s maid! and who’s to say i would’ve even said yes?! (to monica) i mean i would’ve said yes. chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? look, everything worked out okay!"," okay, it’s just weird! okay? i don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and monica! i-i-i need…i don’t know what i need. i need a walk."
5032," wait chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal!"," it is to me. you wanted to sleep with batman, and instead you had to settle for robin. (walks out and slams the door.)"
5033, i gotta go! (runs out.), hey. do you want this scone? (holds up his plate) it came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
5034," chandler, come on nothing even happened!"," look joe, i know you wanted to do the wedding…"
5035," no-hey-no! if you don’t want me to do it, i except that. i don’t care about that. i just…i don’t want you to be upset.", how can i not be upset? okay? i finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
5036," yeah for like a half an hour one night! chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! you’re so lucky! look what i missed out on by not being there! although you know what? it could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. y’know? and you just know it’s gonna last forever.", that’s what you should say.  when you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.
5037, really? i can do it?, i’d love it if you would do it.
5038, hey! (they hug.), but those are the words! those exact words!
5039, so are guys doing okay?," yeah, we talked and monica made me see that i over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important."
5040, food? uh-huh gimme! (she hands him the paper.), so did monica tell you about this great band called the swing kings that we’re trying to get to play at the wedding?
5041, since when are you into swing music?, oh since forever! i used to go all over town listening to bands!  gap commercial. (to monica) so did you book them? did you call?
5042, i will., do you want me to call?
5043, what is your job?, staying out of the way.
5044," (noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) well hello! she’s cute! should we uh, go try to talk to her?", sure! that’s one of the great things about being engaged. i’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
5045," y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (kristen crinkles her nose at that.) before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (he stops when he realizes what he’s talking about.)", (to ross) smooth.
5046, now!!!!!!!! (rachel runs off and monica gets up to follow her.)," so ross, how was your date the other night? did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?"
5047," (entering) hey chandler!  listen, sorry i didn’t stop by last night but i had a date."," uh joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? that’s okay!"
5048," well check it out, i was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!", really? right across the street?  when’d you meet her?
5049, two days ago., excellent! y’know ross met somebody too!
5050, (returning) hey., hi! how’d it go?
5051, oh great! we’re going out again saturday. but i just found she’s also seeing some other guy., (sarcastically shocked) really?! joe? what would you do if you were in ross’s situation?
5052, well you shouldn’t be. believe me i wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you. (chandler laughs.) i mean that doofus is going to lose!," so this is nice! i wish i didn’t have to go, believe me! but unfortunately i have to. (he gets up and joey moves over next to ross.) oh uh, by the way, what’s the name the girl you’re dating?"
5053, kristen lang., bye! (exits.)
5054, yes. yes. just here (runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and there (runs his fingers across his forehead)., joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (he goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)
5055," phoebe, he’s gotta be in the room for that to work.", (returning) what are you guys talking about?
5056," yeah, i went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. and now i’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced.", but i love swing music!
5057, yeah but the swing kings? y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—they just stop living.," look all i know is when monica and i went to see them, we had fun! and there’s another reason too."
5058," well, what is the other reason?", i don’t want to say.
5059, well you have to because maybe it’s stupid., well it’s just while monica and i were dancing to them it was…the first time i knew that…you were the woman i wanted to dance all my dances with.
5060, probably around gonorrhea.," hi, honey! i’m home!"
5061, (from the bedroom) don’t come in here!, why? do you another boyfriend in there or something?
5062, no! we only mess around at his place!," y’know it’s funny i started it but, now it’s scary me. so could you come out here please?"
5063," no, i’m wearing a wedding dress.", oh you got a wedding dress? that’s great!
5064, yeah but i’m not keeping it., well then why can’t i see it?
5065," oh. i guess you can. okay but; i-i have to return it, so you can’t like it."," okay i promise. i’ll-i’ll hate it. (she enters.) wow! you-you look…hideous.  yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress i’ve ever seen. wh-why do you to return it?"
5066," oh because it doesn’t…really fit. oh by the way, i-i booked the swing kings.", oh that’s great! great! thanks! but that dress i mean it’s like yuck! it’s terrible! it makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
5067," okay! but you can’t rip it. well, maybe a little.  (entering) hey guys! do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? (they ignore her.) guys?", (without turning around) i thought you were gonna be gone all day.
5068," see? that’s what i mean. i mean that, that’s great! but i wouldn’t trade in what i have for that. i mean i’m gonna be with chandler for the rest of my life, and that’s what makes me happy. (chandler approaches.) hey sweetie, come here! come sit down. hey phoebe and i were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. it really is don’t you think?", oh totally! (holds up his finger.) pull my finger.
5069," honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?"," okay. well, i think the centerpieces are too big"
5070, you’re wrong! the centerpieces are fine! do you ever get scared at all?, kinda. they’re really big.
5071," doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again?  just, i love you so much. just…it’s just sometimes it bothers me that i’m never gonna have that feeling. y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it’s new and exciting? y’know that rush?"," no. no, see when i first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating."
5072," okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?"," sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and i’m afraid even more sweating."
5073, even with me?," i was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. (monica laughs.) look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.  well yeah! but now that i know that you’re having these thoughts, i’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh i’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink."
5074," come here! come here! (they hug.) sweetie you don’t have to worry. no, besides y’know what? i’m gonna have a lot of new things with you. the first time we buy a house. our first kid. our first grandkid…", (hoarsely) water! water! water!
5075, i don’t know. (timidly) a cowboy theme?, y’know i’m-i’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
5076, oh boy me too!," y’know i was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…  technically we could have sex again. what do you think, bossy and domineering?!"
5077," the wedding is off, sloppy and immature!", that’s me! come on!
5078," okay. (they both jump up to head for there room, but monica stops.) but wait, we can’t. my cousin cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch."," well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
5079, i thought i heard voices. you must be chandler., (transfixed) hi! nice to meet you!
5080, (catching him) chandler!, i’ll be right with you.
5081, what?! chandler she’s our cousin!, i was not staring at her. okay? i was just listening intently. it’s called being a good conversationalist. watch. (stares at monica’s eyes.) say something.
5082, she looks exactly like aunt marilyn.," umm, so this aunt marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?"
5083," (to chandler) okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours."," this is so sad. i mean, i only have like ten pins."
5084, well-well—see? parents are comin’!, y’know i think we should invite them.
5085," oh please, you just want more blue pins.", well this is just sad!
5086," oh, get out of here! (jumps back and walks away.)  (motioning to a rack) so now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. anything at all. (grabs a few) but these are the three that monica pre-approved."," well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up rach. i want you to know that i want you to attend our wedding as my guest."
5087, i’m monica’s maid of honor. okay? don’t try to blue pin me!," (sees another rack) well, what’s the deal with these? these-these look nice."
5088, oh they are nice. we-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back., you mean like for award shows?
5089, some of them.," you mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, ""you are you wearing?! you look fabulous!"""
5090," honey, might i suggest watching a little more espn and a little less e!?"," okay, who wore those? (points to the tuxedos.)"
5091," umm, well let’s see uh, this one is tom brokaw.", not bad.
5092, (reading a tag) this one is uh paul o’neil., who’s that?
5093," he plays for the yankees. seriously, espn! just once and a while, have it on in the background. (chandler nods and rachel grabs another tux) ooh, this one was pierce brosnan!"," pierce brosnan? 007?! this is james bond’s tux?!  oh, i have to get married in james bond’s tux!"
5094, it’s a pretty cool tux.," oh, it’s not just that, i would be england’s most powerful weapon. jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. a man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (worried.) would monica let me wear this?"
5095, hey! guess what i got for your wedding! (holding up his garment bag.), a freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
5096," no. rachel hooked me up with a tux! but not just any tux, batman’s tux!  that’s right! made expressly for val kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that batman film he was in.", you can’t wear that! i’m wearing the famous tux! james bond’s tux!  so—if you wear that you’ll make mine less special.
5097," well, you need something to make this day special? hello! you-you-you have the most special thing of all! you are marrying the woman you love."," please, don’t take away my cool thing. please?! pretty please?!"
5098,"pretty please? not very uh, 007."," look, it’s my wedding day okay? if you were getting married i would never do anything to upset you."
5099, when i got married you slept with my sister.,that was pretty 007.
5100," oh wow, ray-ray i have no idea what you’re talking about.", ross is batman!
5101," well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.", rachel got ross the tuxedo that val kilmer wore in batman. okay batman is so much cooler than james bond!
5102,what are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!, batman has a utility belt!
5103,007 has a fancy car!, batman has the batmobile!
5104,007 gets all the ladies., batman has robin! (pause) we get espn right?
5105,how about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and i’ll make you a nice martini.," actually, i don’t like martinis."
5106, how about a youhoo with a funny straw?," ooh, yum! (runs into the bedroom.)"
5107, gunther. (to chandler) hey-hey! why don’t we put them on? y’know get a picture of batman and james bond together., i would but mine doesn’t fit. the pants are a little tight.
5108, well that stinks. i was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.," well, does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?"
5109, what are you kidding? it’s batman’s tux!!, (standing up) let me try it on!
5110," okay, but just the jacket. double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.", (trying on the jacket) okay. holy double-vented comfort batman! (finds something in the pocket) what’s this?  an invitation for the at first sight premiere? oh my god! val kilmer didn’t wear this in batman! he wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
5111, let me see that! (grabs the invitation and reads it.) oh man!, the only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (hands him the jacket and walks away.)
5112, (defeated) oh.," well, you’re welcome. and tell them we’re really glad they’re coming."
5113, i just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  i’ve had better., (yelling from the changing room) all right! i found one that fits!
5114,"well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm. (chandler enters.) aww, look at you all handsome!", whose is it?
5115, oh does it matter?! all that matters is that you look so handsome.  i don’t want to say.," oh, come on! i don’t care! come on! whose is it?"
5116, do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married? four weeks baby!! four weeks!!!, do you realize you get louder each week?
5117, there’s still so much to do. have you written your vows yet?," i figured i’d buy those. pat, i’d like to buy a vow. (laughs)"
5118," sweetie, you know i have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding."," right. so uh, have you written yours yet?"
5119, no! but i know exactly what i’m going to say., do you happen to know what i’m going to say?
5120," (handing him a pad of paper and a pen) let’s just do it right now. okay? it won’t be hard. just say what’s in your heart. (she goes back, sits down, and starts feverishly writing.)"," (watching in her) (in his head) look at her go! she must love me more than i love her! what’s wrong with me? ooh, don’t open that door.  (writing) monica, there are no words… (to joey and ross) there are no words! this should not be this hard!"
5121," well with carol, i promised never to love another woman until the day i die. she made no such promise."," i’m so pathetic! monica knows what she wants to say! you should’ve seen her. writing, writing, writing!"
5122," well, why don’t you just start with something simple. like umm, monica from the moment i met you, i knew i loved you."," yeah, i’m not sure i can do that."
5123, well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. maybe you just say something about y’know all the things that he’s taught you. like… (they all try to think about one example and don’t succeed.) or all the things you taught him., (shocked) there are seven?! (points to one) that’s one?
5124," oh, i got it! how about saying something like, ""monica…", (writing) monica…
5125," ""…when i look back over our time together…""", (writes what joey said and waits for him to go on) yeah?
5126," (screaming) i’m getting married today!! ahh, whoo-hoo!!(he runs back out the door.)","  y’know i was thinking, what if i uh, unpack here?  okay! (he joins her on one knee) okay! okay! i'll do it!  oh god, i thought… (starting to cry, pauses) wait a minute, i-i can do this. (pause) i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it. then i realized the only thing that matters is that you, (pause) you make me happier than i ever thought i could be. (starting to cry again.) and if you’ll let me, i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (pause as he gets out the ring.) monica, will you marry me?"
5127," believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.","yeah, can i get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a coke—(yelps in pain as monica grabs him underwater)—diet coke."
5128, (entering the hall) oh man! aren't you guys done yet?!," (swallowing hard) it's very, very nice. well, come here. i'm very happy were gonna have all the sex."
5129, oh that’s so sweet., so we both finished our vows.
5130," (to chandler) oh man, this is hilarious."," don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier.  okay, what do you guys think?"
5131, (starting to cry) i have never known love like this., you really like it?
5132, dude! how-how did you write this?, i stole monica’s and changed the name.
5133," chandler, we still haven’t gotten an rsvp from your dad."," oh! right. umm, maybe that’s because i didn’t send him an invitation."
5134, chandler! he’s your father; he should be at the wedding., i don’t even know the man. okay? we’re not the close. i haven’t seen him in years.
5135, well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!," well he doesn’t have to know! it’s not like we run in the same circles. i hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in vegas."
5136," ooh, i think i wanna trade circles."," trust me, you don’t want him there either. okay? nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress."
5137, here! (she sets a bag down in front of him.)  it’s your suitcase. we’re going to las vegas., are you serious?! i mean like eloping?! no more stupid wedding stuff?! no more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—think of the money we’ll save!! (monica just looks at him.) we’re not eloping. i love the flowers. can our wedding be bigger please?
5138," we’re going to las vegas to see your dad. it’s time you two talked, and i want to get to know my father-in-law.", y’know we already went over this and i won!
5139," no you didn’t. oh and honey just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.", look forget it okay? i don’t want to go. i don’t want to see him. i don’t wanna.
5140," chandler, look i-i know that your dad embarrassed you. i know…"," no-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through. when i was in high school, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet. y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. you’re skinny. you’re wearing speedoes—that your mom promised that you would grow into! and you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda. we was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!"
5141," hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! okay? that’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.", he had sex with mr. girabaldi!
5142, who’s mr. girabaldi?, does it matter?!
5143," chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. okay? maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. if your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life."," yeah o-okay, but i’m just doing this for you.  so i really never get to win anymore?"
5144, (to chandler) hm-mmm?," yeah, i just ordered a beer! (pounds the table.)"
5145, i still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.," no! no! i don’t want him to know we’re yet! i’m not sure i’m ready for that. and besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.  i don’t know if i’ve told you this, but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years  yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to new york, but i always said i was too busy to see him. y’know it’s all very cats in the cradle—i don’t want to get into it. (the show starts.) here we go."
5146, hello darlings., and there’s daddy!
5147, that can’t be your father.," believe me, i’ve been saying that for years. oh my god!  that’s mr. girabaldi playing the piano."
5148, (singing) for i’m loved by a pretty wonderful boy! (applause.) hello! and welcome to the show. i see some of our regulars in the audience. and a couple of irregulars. (he starts going into the audience.), he’s coming into the audience. he’s coming into the audience.
5149, no-no i heard! i’m just sorry., it can’t happen like this. okay? i’ll meet you back at the hotel.
5150, so what’s your name?, (resigning himself to his fate) chandler. (he quickly sits down.)
5151, chandler? what an unusual name! you must’ve had terribly fascinating parents.," oh, they’re a hoot."
5152," i’m not very fond of new york. queens i like. (noticing monica’s ring.) ooh, what is this sparkle something! (shows the audience who woos.) honey! huh?", actually monica and i are engaged.
5153," (disappointed) i see. well, i wish you both a lifetime of happiness. (to a bald guy.) so you’re bald?", wait! wait! we’d really love it if you could be there.
5154, we? (looks at monica who nods.)," i know it would make me happy, ma’am."
5155, (to chandler) you okay?, yeah. thanks for making me do this.
5156, amen!, (to monica) when i was growing up i…played the one on the far left.
5157, why?! what’s happening to the coffee house?! (monica looks at her.) oh! (realizes.), yep! from now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. the little woman. the wife. the old ball and chain.
5158, old?, the young hot ball and chain.
5159," (to chandler) y’know what? actually i’m kinda glad they’re leaving ‘cause uh, i need to talk to you about something.", what’s up?
5160," well this uh, this may be a little awkward.","listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. i’m buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night."
5161," no, its…its not that. umm, now what i’m going to say to you, i’m not saying as your friend. okay? i’m-i’m saying as it as monica’s older brother.", but you’re still my friend?
5162, not for the next few minutes.," during this time…are you, are you still my best man?  do i still call you ross?"
5163," okay! you guys are getting married tomorrow and-and i couldn’t be more thrilled for both of you, but as monica’s older brother i-i have to tell you this. if you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, i will hunt you down, and kick your ass! (chandler laughs.) what? i’m-i’m-i’m serious! (chandler laughs harder.) come—hey! dude! stop it! okay? i’m-i’m not kidding here!"," (smiling) hey, i hear what your saying, okay? and, thanks for the warning.  so are we…friends again?  okay. (pause) you won’t believe what monica’s older brother just said to me!"
5164," honey, we gotta go!", (entering from the bedroom) okay. here’s a question you never have to ask. my dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
5165," (laughs) i don’t have anything like that, but let me go see if rachel does."," yes, include more people in this."
5166," hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we’ll be getting married?", wait a minute! i have a date tomorrow night.
5167," i just, i can’t believe that we made it!", well you don’t have to sound so surprised.
5168," i’m sorry but…nothing.  well…honestly ever since we got engaged i have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.", honestly? me too.  yeah. y’know i keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and i’ll go all…chandler. but nothing has.
5169," ohh, i’m so glad. thank you so much for staying so calm during this. i mean it’s really, it’s made me stay calm. (chandler just looks at her.) i coulda been worse!", okay. i’ll be right there.
5170," (voice on answering machine) hi! if you’re calling before saturday, you’ve reached monica and chandler. but if you’re calling after saturday, you’ve reached mr. and mrs. bing! please leave a message for the bings!  hey maureen!

5171, hi! oh you guys look so beautiful!, mr. and mrs. bing! (walks away.)
5172, (entering) hello all!, hi…dad.
5173, don’t you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?, oh my god! (he and monica walk away.)
5174," aw, y’know…y’know, maybe we’re-we’re just approaching this all wrong. if you’re chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on earth people would think you’d go?  so this is your office?", how did you guys find me? i knew i should’ve hid at the gym!
5175, what the hell are you doing?!, panicking! and using the internet to try to prove that i’m related to monica. how is she?
5176," she’s fine. she doesn’t know you’re gone. and she doesn’t have to know, okay? now come on, we’re going home.", no! no! no! i can’t do that!
5177, why not?!," because if i go home, we’re gonna become the bings! i can’t be the bings!"
5178, what’s wrong with being the bings?, the bings have horrible marriages! they yell. they fight. and they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
5179," chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?  then you are neither of your parents!"," it’s not just their marriage! i mean, look at yours. look at everybody’s! the only person that can make marriage work is paul newman! and i’ve met me; i am not paul newman. i don’t race cars! i don’t make popcorn! none of my proceeds go to charity."
5180," but look chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than i do. but i totally believe you can do this."," i want to. i love her so much, but i’m afr…it’s too huge."
5181," y’know, okay. you’re right. it is huge. so why don’t we take it just a little bit at a time? okay? umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. can you just come home and take a shower?"," well yeah, but then…"
5182," (interrupting him) yeah—no-but-but-but-but! we’re just gonna go home and take a shower. now, that’s not scary right?", depends on what you mean by we.
5183," there you go. you put on a tuxedo! now that wasn’t so scary, was it?  i’m telling you, just a little bit at a time."," yeah okay. well, what’s the next little bit?"
5184," getting married. (chandler panics.) okay. okay. you can, you can do that too! just like you’ve done everything else!"," yeah. you’re right. hey i-i can do that.  okay, excuse me for a minute. (starts to leave)"
5185," wh—hey—whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!"," ross, i am not gonna run away again! i just want to get a little fresh air.  oh fresh air!"
5186, you’re not getting away this time mister! unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!, ross! (he starts to get up.)
5187, hiiii-ya!! (chandler lies back down.) i’m serious! you’re not walking out on my sister!, (standing up) that’s right! i’m not!
5188, then where the hell have you been?!, i know about monica.

5191, what? you’ll hi-ya?, monica’s pregnant.
5192, oh my god. oh my god! and you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?, well i was! then i went down to the gift shop because i was out of cigarettes…
5193, cigarettes?!!," big picture please! so i was in the gift shop, and that’s when i uh, saw this. (he holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads i (heart) new york.) yeah, y’know what? i thought anything that can fit into this, can’t be scary."
5194,well you obviously didn’t see chucky 3.," but come on, look at how cute and small this is! so i got it to give monica so she’d know i was okay."
5195, oh look at you! so handsome!, you look beautiful mom. (his dad clears his throat.) you look beautiful too dad. i love you both. (he kisses his dad on the cheek) i’m so glad you here. (he kisses his mom.)
5196, are you chandler?, are you joey?
5197, i love you sweetheart. (he kisses her and they sit down.), you look beautiful. is this new? (her dress.)
5198, i am father kalebasous., (in monica’s ear) he’s greek orthodox.
5199," chandler, for so long i…i wondered if i would ever find my prince, my soul mate. then three years ago, at another wedding i turned to a friend for comfort. and in stead, i found everything that i’d ever been looking for my whole life. and now…here we are…with our future before us…and i only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. unless you don’t want to. you go!"," (to ross) no, that’s okay. (ross nods and retreats.) monica i thought this was going to be the most difficult thing i ever gonna had to do. but when i saw you walking down that aisle i realized how simple it was. i love you. any surprises that come our way it’s okay, because i will always love you. you are the person i was meant to spend the rest of my life with. you wanna know if i’m sure? (he leans in and kisses her.)"
5200," you may not kiss the bride. so, i guess by the powers vested in my by the state of new york and the internet guys, i now pronounce you husband and wife. oh wait! do you take each other?", i do.
5201," aw crap! okay—uh…uh let’s-let’s do the rings.  we good? yeah? good? once again, i pronounce you husband and wife. (to chandler) now kiss her again.", (to monica) i love you. and i know about the baby.
5202, what baby?, our baby.
5203, we have a baby?, phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
5204, i didn’t take a pregnancy test., then…who did?
5205," we found your test in the trash, if you’re not pregnant—(she sees rachel shaking her head)—it’s because i am.", what?! what are you talking about?
5206, wait a minute! so you told people i was pregnant?! (flash) does this look like a conversation that i want to remember?!, who’s the father?
5207," okay, okay. it’s james brolin. james brolin is the father of my baby.", as in barbara streisand’s husband james brolin?
5208, how about just the bridemaids?, y’know i am the groom right? i was told it was kinda big deal.
5209," thank you very much! ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, mr. and mrs. chandler bing!", before we go out there i’ve got a present for ya.
5210," honey, i’m going to put my hand in your pocket!"," no?  i’ve been taking dancing lessons.  yeah, the last six weeks. i wanted this to be a moment you will never forget."
5211, oh that is so sweet!," so? would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?  i don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re all slippery."
5212," well, are you going to be able to do this?", not well.
5213, dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover., bravo dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
5214," well, it’s a funny story.", funny: ha-ha or funny: (mimes blowing his brain out.)
5215," chandler. will you see if your mom can give my resume to dennis phillips? ‘cause if i can get in a broadway show then i would’ve done it all, film, television, and theater. the only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly people.", what size shoes do you wear?
5216," uh, eleven, eleven and a half."," great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can i borrow the boots from your costume?"
5217," uh, i don’t even really know where i left those. sorry.", (looking at joey’s feet) those aren’t eleven and a half.
5218, keep dancing., and the world will never know.
5219, hey! did you talk to dennis about me yet?," yes, i told him how talented you were. i told him all about days of our lives."
5220, no-no! no! no! you don’t tell a broadway guy that! now he just thinks i’m a soap actor., but you’re not just a soap actor. you are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
5221," hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?", did it turn into sand?
5222," ohh come on, i love this song! come on, you’ll be fine. (she starts to walk towards the floor.)"," (sliding up behind her) no. no, i won’t. do you know why i took all those lessons? see, for the first time i didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot."
5223, no. (phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to joey who gets mad.) i was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!, (to the front desk clerk) hi! we’re checking out of the bridal suite.
5224," (depressed) that’s right. i’m no longer a bride. i’ll never be a bride again. now, i’m just someone’s wife!"," and i’m the happiest guy in the world! (monica goes and sits down in a huff.) oh honey, come on don’t be upset. we still have so much to look forward to!"
5225," oh yeah, right. (rolls her eyes.)", we got the honeymoon.
5226, that’s not ‘til thursday., the wedding pictures?
5227, they won’t be ready for weeks., not the disposable cameras from the tables.
5228, that’s true! (happily) i knew i married you for a reason!," i’ll tell you what, i will go get them developed and you can go home.  what? what did you take a picture of?"
5229, nothing! it was something.," okay ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?"
5230," yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. until y’know, he screamed out radisson at the end.","okay, well i’m gonna get ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (joey laughs again.) 32 joe. you’re 32! (exits)"
5231," yeah, that’s sad. mashuga nut?", hey. (he sees that ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) soaps? shampoos? are you really taking all this stuff?
5232, why not? it’s built into the price of the room., yeah but you don’t need—(picks up something)—what is this?
5233, thread!, score! where are the disposable cameras?
5234, what disposable cameras?, the cameras? remember last night i told you to take them?
5235, no you didn’t.," yes! remember? right before we cut the cake, i went up to you and i said…"
5236," oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if i could do you a favor, and my uncle murray came up to you and handed you a check. and then you said, ""why do they call it a check? why not a yugoslavian?"" (chandler laughs.) yeah, then you did that.", so you don’t have the cameras?!
5237, no. sorry man., so? what? what? they’re gone! monica’s gonna freak!
5238," well, i’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. i’ll-i’ll help you look for them.", great.
5239, no. did you?, yes! and that’s why i’m under the table. celebrating.
5240," well i checked in the uh, lost and found, i talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them."," well this is great. y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer monica up today, she’s really depressed."
5241," now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?", all my energy is going into not asking that question. i can’t believe i screwed this up!
5242, i’m sorry man. (formally dressed people start to enter.) here’s a thought. this is the same ballroom. there’s a band. there’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people., are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
5243," no-no-no, i’m saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. all we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.  i’m just thinking about your new bride at home. okay? do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?", marriage advice? really?!
5244," i’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! aren’t these the same flowers?"," i don’t know, monica picked out the flowers."
5245, what about the chairs?, she picked those out too.
5246, how about the place settings?, that was her.
5247, what did you do?, i was in charge of the cameras! gift shop?

5250, why won’t you take our picture?," oh yeah. i’ll take, i’ll take your picture. (he takes the picture with his finger over the lens.)"
5251," uh, your finger was covering the lens.", who are you? ansel adams?! get outta here!
5252, hey rach., why don’t you go up on stage. i’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.
5253, well go! go move it! (he runs off.)," okay, you ready for the last picture?  get ready to run. (chandler walks over to the new bride.) congratulations on your wedding. (he grabs her, kisses her, ross takes the picture, and they both run out.)"
5254, there you go!, we’re back!
5255, great! we’re hangin’ in the kitchen! (she drags him into the kitchen and turns his back to the living room) let’s stay in the kitchen!, it’s picture time.
5256, now you are going to love these.," (showing her the pictures) here’s a picture of ross. (shows another one.) and that’s me. (another one.) and that’s me and ross. (another one.) oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple."
5257, wow! that is a great picture!, eh?
5258," huh, didn’t see that coming."," okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. which by the look on your face i’m sure you’ll remember. so we don’t need—(rips the picture)—there’s no need to have this picture. how about i take the real pictures and get them developed right now."
5259, that would be a good idea., okay. (sees the living room.) you opened all the presents without me?! i thought we were supposed to do that together!
5260, you kissed another woman!, call it even?!

5264," oh no, i already packed. the only thing i couldn’t find though was your speedo."," a speedo? uh, i don’t have a speedo. i’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. (goes into the bedroom.)"
5265," well i guess there is no harm in telling you now, rachel and ross are gonna have a baby.", (in a high pitched voice) what?! i didn’t even know that—why didn’t you tell me?! (pause) why am i talking like this?!
5266, i didn’t think you could keep it a secret., (in the high pitched voice) what?! (normal voice) i am an excellent secret keeper. i have kept all of our secrets.
5267, what secrets?," oh no-no joey, i am not going to tell you because i am an excellent secret keeper."

5291," that’s less embarrassing, yes. yes i was.  (voiceover) so when she came in, i got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [cut back to the present day.] it kept rolling and recorded everything."," yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape. (they rest of them agree.)"

5295, what about my questions?," the sheer volume, it was like flying with the riddler!"
5296," oh, i’m sorry. was that another joke?", (angrily) was that another question?
5297," kinda hurtin’ my hand though.  (on tape) (ross hands her a glass of wine) i cannot believe that i did this. especially after monica just went on and on and on about it! (mimicking monica) ""okay rachel! here are the invitations rachel! now be very careful rachel! please, drinking no liquids around the invitations rachel!"" (she tilts her wine glass above and moves it back and forth across the invitations) whoa oh! oh-oh-oh! oh…oh-oh-oh…", did you do it on our invitations?!

5307," well, why don’t you correct him?"," oh it’s been going on way to long now. y’know, i mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so i didn’t say anything. and then the next time he said, ""hey toby, do you want a donut?"" and i-i wanted a donut. and now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and i’m still toby."
5308, five years?! chandler you have to tell him!," no! that would be so awkward! look—besides, we work in different departments. he’s on the sixth floor y’know? so he calls me toby once in a while. what’s the big deal? it could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling me muriel. (chandler suddenly freezes into place.)"
5309," (laughs) muriel. wh-why would he call you muriel? (ross realizes something.) oh my god! chandler m bing? it’s not just an m, your middle name is muriel!!", shh! it is a family name!

5311, hey! how’s my pal toby doing today?," if i see him, i’ll ask."
5312, hey-hey! bing? was that bob from six you were just talking too?  oh then you know each other., we’re on a semi-first name basis.
5313, what do you think of adding him to our team?," bob? ooh, working here with us? everyday? yeah, i don’t know if he has what it takes."
5314, really? they love him down on six., but this is eleven. it’s almost twice as hard up here.
5315," okay, i hear you loud and clear. bob will stay put.", i think it’s best sir.
5316, but we really do need to find someone up here. the work is starting to pile up. i’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high. (holds his hand at shoulder level.)," y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em."
5317, (laughs) that’s a good one. (walks away.), what does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
5318," hey toby, you got a sec?"," sure, what’s up?"
5319, hey toby!, hey bobby.
5320," it’s bob actually. hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this chandler bing’s office is?"," uhh yeah. yeah, it’s (points down the hall) right, right down there.

5321," i want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is."," okay bob listen uhh, i’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here."
5322, toby don’t., bob!
5323, toby! i’m not gonna let you cover for him. anything you say right now will just get me more upset with chandler!, well that puts me in a difficult position.
5324," no way! look, halloween is so stupid! dressing up, pretending to be someone you’re not…", you’re an actor!
5325," no, it’s me. phoebe!"," (entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) monica! can i talk to you for a second? listen, i appreciate you getting me the costume…"
5326, what?! i thought he’d love it! his favorite kid's book was the velveteen rabbit!, the velveteen rabbit was brown and white!
5327," well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.", no bunny at all!! always no bunny at all!!!
5328," yes i did! i’m chandler. (looks at chandler) dude, what happened?", how is that me?
5329, (to chandler) that is so you!, when have i ever done that?!
5330," remember the russian satellite, sputnik? (they all look at him.) well, i’m a potato or a…spud. and these are my antennae. (points to the colander with an old tv antenna glued on top that he’s wearing.) so sputnik, becomes… (they’re still confused) spud-nik. spudnik!", wow! i don’t have the worst costume anymore!
5331, hey mona!, oh! hi!  joey’s gonna be thrilled! he was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse.
5332," umm, actually i’m just a nurse."," you’d think that would embarrass me, but you see i’m maxed out."
5333, and the antennae…oh my god you’re spudnik!, (to ross) marry her.
5334, sure., howdy doody.
5335, that’s funny. yeah. y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.," oh relax man, relax. you’re looking a little flushed."
5336," (to monica) hey-hey-hey, i think we might find out the answer to our question.", what question?
5337," monica and i were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or ross?", there’s no question.
5338, so you think ross too?, (to monica) you picked ross?!
5339," ross is really strong! okay, he’s the strongest out of all three of you! (joey looks at her.) except for joey.", i cannot believe you didn’t pick me.
5340," uh, in her defense, she’s right. i am stronger. i would destroy you.", oh really?! you think you’re stronger? why don’t you prove it? (he pushes ross who starts to fall backwards until mona catches him.)
5341, yeah. listen to the slutty nurse., (to ross) you’re going down.
5342," (to chandler) look honey, you don’t have to do this, okay? it’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. you’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity! that’s the kind of strength that i want in the man that i love!", that means nothing to me. (to ross) come on!
5343, pride., and dignity.
5344," (to chandler) so, you gettin’ tired?", nope! i can do this all day.
5345, yeah? me too. (pause) gettin’ a little tired though.," god, i’m exhausted."
5346," look this is starting to look really bad for me. okay? mona, mona’s standing right over there. (looks behind him.) oh god, she’s talking to joey! you gotta let me win!", no way! if anything you’ve gotta let me win! my wife thinks i’m a wimp!
5347," hey, at least you have a wife! i-i keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! and i’m dressed as doody.", you’re spudnik.
5348," come on, who are we kidding? i’m doody. please? she’s watchin’.", fine. (he lets ross win.) oh no!
5349," look, i wanted to tell i’m-i’m sorry you lost."," listen, i’ve got a secret for ya. i let him win."
5350, (laughs) is that a secret or a lie.," no, i let him win—ross!  would you tell her i let you win please?"
5351," oh. yeah. (sarcastically) uh chandler let me win. no, chandler’s really strong. oh my arm is so sore. oh nurse! (waddles over to mona.)", i am strong! i’ll show you! (he sits down at the table.)
5352, chandler please!, oh what’s the matter? are you scared?
5353, let’s go big bunny!,"okay. 1…2…3—go! (once again he’s at a stalemate, but this time he’s in pain.) (pause) i’m gonna kill myself!"
5354," oh my god! you cleaned! (gasps) look at these floors! you did the windows! oh, i have been begging you for months and you did! you cleaned! and nagging works!"," y’know uh, i didn’t actually do this."
5355," oh no, was i cleaning in my sleep again?"," no, it wasn’t you."
5356, well then who?, i got a maid. yay!
5357," (shocked) i hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then…"," uh honey, i know you don’t like to relinquish control…"
5358," oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!"," look, she’s really nice. okay? and she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges."
5359, did she really say that?," yes, i distinctly remember ‘cause i thought it was a joke. now just give her a chance, okay?"
5360," fine, i can do it. (gets anxious.) whew.", what’s the matter?
5361, okay. (as brenda exits monica notices something.), see? i told you.
5362, she stole my jeans!, (pause) what?
5363, i have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!, so she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
5364, don’t you see? it’s the perfect crime!, she must’ve been planning this for years!
5365, i will prove it to you! okay? about a week ago i was wearing those jeans and i dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. now when she comes back i will find it and show you that stain!," honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?"
5366, i guess.," so, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?"
5367, fine. i’m just glad i didn’t give her my secret ingredient.," out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?"
5368, really? that’s the thing i’m worse at! you’ll see. (exits.), (entering) hi!
5369," hey! umm, i think brenda needs a raise.", how come?
5370, because i put my head between her legs., to see her pants?
5371, they’re my pants!, are you sure? did you see the stain?
5372, no! i was just getting into position and then everything went dark.," god! she is not stealing from us! okay, will you let this go?"
5373, fine. (brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra strap on the way.) she’s wearing my bra!, oh dear god!
5374, my pink flowered bra! i recognize the strap!, and yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.
5375, here’s the plan! okay? i’m going to leave you get a look at brenda’s bra!, here’s another plan…no!
5376, i would do it but she thinks i’m attracted to her!  did you not hear where my head was? come on! come on we’re a team! we’re in this together!, i fear a jury will see it the same way!
5377," do this for me! come on, i catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!", you see that?
5378, do you see this? (mimics him drooling over a woman’s breasts.), all right. yes. okay. i get your point. but if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
5379," yes! absolutely. okay? look, you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip.", you need new clothes.
5380, (noticing him) what are you doing?, i’m leaning. this is where i lean.
5381, okay. (goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch., brenda a bee!
5382, i think i know what’s going on here., you do?
5383," look, i know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it’s wrong. you’re married.", i totally understand. (they both laugh.) can i just see your bra?
5384, oh my god!!! monica!! he’s the stripper from your bachelorette party!!, her what?!!
5385, your secret bachelorette party…, you had a bachelorette party?!
5386, she untied his g-string with her teeth. (pause) somebody stop me!," i thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition."
5387," this is so unfair! the one thing i wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, i wasn’t allowed to. all i got was a stupid steak dinner!", you went home with the waitress.
5388," oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.", i can’t believe you didn’t tell me! you know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
5389," oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. it was amazing! (she leaves.)", my god! you must be good in bed!
5390," well, i was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!", she’s okay with rachel and the baby?
5391," well i…i haven’t actually told her yet. i don’t want to scare her off, y’know?"," well, you have to honest with her! otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones."
5392," (entering) oh my god! you are gonna love me so much! i felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you’re gonna have a bachelor party.  yeah, i got this number from this guy at work and i hired a stripper to come dance for you. am i going in the wife hall of fame or what?!", honey! that’s crazy! i don’t want you to get me a stripper…
5393," come on! come on, it’ll be fun! it’ll make me feel so much better."," look, i appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. y’know? i’m not a bachelor anymore."
5394, please! i feel so bad! just watch the hot woman get naked!, all right fine! but i’m only doing this for you!  and joey.
5395," thank you. all right, now who else do you want to invite?"," ah, no-no-no just ross. ross and joey is embarrassing enough."
5396," uh actually, sorry i can’t even make it. i’m seeing mona again tonight.", i understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
5397," so you uh, nervous about getting married?  look, look let’s pretend it’s a real bachelor party. okay? y’know? before your wedding. come on, it’ll be fun.", okay. i can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.
5398, how does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another woman again huh? knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.," you’re right, this is more fun."
5399, hi!, hi. (joey blows on a noisemaker.)
5400," uh, that-that’s-that’s me!", that’s me.
5401, so is that a bedroom? (points to the guestroom.)," yeah, yeah right over there."
5402," all right, whenever you’re ready. (she goes into the bedroom.)", that was weird.
5403, i’m waiting., so she’s a…
5404," i’m sorry. dr. green, mona. mona, dr. green.", i can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!
5405," wait! wait! maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she’s supposed to do."," could be. i mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. (walks towards the bedroom.) ma’am, are you also a stripper?"
5406," maybe monica’s playing a joke on ya. y’know? getting her own husband a hooker, that’s pretty funny."," that is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone."
5407, do you mind if i smoke in here?," oh actually, i’d rather you…yeah, go ahead. we’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway."
5408, maybe she meant to get you a hooker., why would she do that?
5409," maybe she wants you to learn something. huh? now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?", this is the worst bachelor party ever!
5410, in a minute!, (to joey) in a minute? what’s gonna happen in a minute?!
5411," all right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.", why me?!
5412, hey! it’s your bachelor party., which is why you should do it.
5413, i don’t want to. you do it!, you do it!
5414, you do it!," all right rock, paper, scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! (joey smirks.) what?"
5415, i miss this., i don’t think we’ve actually done this before!
5416," no, i-i miss hanging out with you.", well we…we still hang out.
5417, not like we used to. remember? you and me used to be inseparable. y’know now it’s like…things are different.," well y’know, things are different. i’m…i’m married now."
5418," oh sure—and hey, don’t get me wrong, i am so happy for you guys. i just…i miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?"," yeah, i miss that too. i tell you what; from now on we’ll make time to hang out with each other."
5419, i swear i didn’t know she was a hooker! i mean wh—did you let her smoke in here?," her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?"
5420," y’know what? i’m gonna make this up to you. i promised you a stripper (turns on the radio), and you’re gonna get a stripper. (she starts to strip.)", monica! wait!  (puts on his crown) carry on.
5421," ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. i think i’ll take them off. (goes to do so.)", could you not narrate?
5422," yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (monica exits.) (to chandler) so how’s the game?", yeah! i’m just pretending to watch the game so i don’t have to help out with stuff.
5423, i don’t believe you! that is…brilliant! and monica has no idea?, nope! every once and a while i just scream stuff at the tv.
5424, is your team winning hon?, yeah! anderson just scored again! (to phoebe) there’s no anderson.
5425, well you look incredible too! you’re just—you’re so fit!," i’m watching the game, but i’m not deaf!"
5426," nope. uh, it’s okay. it’s just uh, god i hated her.  yeah, i hated her. she was horrible to me in high school. but hey, it was a long time ago, i’m in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. you got any cakes or cookies or something? (starts looking.) no will no!"," (to phoebe) y’know, it’s been a while since we’ve screamed something. maybe we should."
5427, oh okay., oh come on!
5428," okay, dinner’s ready!", good game!  yeah. solid effort. solid effort.
5429, (simultaneously) green bay., (simultaneously) detroit.
5430, everyone at our school heard it!, everybody at my school heard it! you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island?!
5431, mrs. altman? she also made out with takaka ci-kek the night before he went back to thailand.,i’m sorry. when you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
5432,hey! she didn’t look 50!,did she look 16?
5433, she didn’t photograph well!," well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!"
5434," well joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you."," yes, i believe we can expect a call from the president any moment now."
5435, hey! so what do you think?, new haircut? (monica nods ‘no.’) necklace? (no) dress? (no) boots? (monica nods ‘yes.’) boots!
5436," yes! now, they’re a little more than i normally spend on boots…or rent (shows him the receipt.)", i’m gonna miss being able to afford food.
5437," i’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! and the saleswoman was looking at me like, ""oh, these are way too expensive for you.""", she had a point. (shows her the receipt.)
5438, they’re mine!," yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them."
5439," honey, i’m not returning them. okay? i mean i-i know they cost a lot, but i’m going to wear them all the time. you’ll see. besides, i love the compliments. i mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?", i have you.
5440, hey guys!, hey-hey.
5441," see chandler? i’m getting a lot of use out of them already! they’re very practical. see, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…", you can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. (goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)
5442, i can’t do that either! the soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood., (returning to his seat) hey!
5443, hey i uh just picked up ben from school…, (spinning around looking for him) i don’t think you did a very thorough job!
5444, (standing up) ahhhhhhhh!, (opening the door) what’s wrong?
5445, oh nothing i’m just—just was yawning. (mimics the groan from before and stretches.)," oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (they go into the apartment.)"
5446," honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?"," now sweetie, i know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. see? every cloud has a…supple leather lining."
5447," i-i don’t-i don’t think that i’m gonna wear the boots tonight.  well y’know, i’m just-i’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. or! or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!", do you think i work at some kind of boot pricing company?
5448," anyway, i picked up this outfit that i want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it."," you said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!"
5449," uh-huh. uh-huh. umm, could-could i get a copy of that? ‘cause carol threw it out, she lost ours. she’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass."," y’know, that party wasn’t bad."
5450, yeah! i didn’t know there would be dancing. that was a fun surprise!," i don’t see any uh, cabs. maybe we should just walk?"
5451," oh no, we can’t walk!"," what honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. let’s go."
5452," hey! do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?  i can’t walk. okay? okay? these boots were a huge mistake!  okay you were right! all right, i never should have bought them! they’re killing me! one toe at a time!", so i was right. this is what it feels like to be right. (pause) it’s oddly unsettling.
5453, how are we gonna get home? maybe a piggy-back ride?, hop on.
5454," okay. wait, just give me a second, i need to just get my boots off first. (she starts taking them off.) ah…ooh…oohh…ohh…oh god…ohh…oh…ohh…ohhhh…"," honey, i know you’re in pain right now, but i’m a little turned on."
5455, the police? here? a reunion?! (she gets out her camera.)," okay, ten blocks down. five to go."
5456, (notices something in the window) oh wait! stop! stop! stop!, oh i’m sorry! do you need a break?
5457, my boots in tan! hey! can you get a little closer so i can see the price?, i can see it from right here. it’ll cost you one husband.
5458," okay, i’m sorry. i think i can walk the rest of the way now. just-just give me my boots.", (pause) i don’t have your boots.
5459, well i don’t have them either. where are they?," well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while i chew on a bale of hay!"
5460," okay. (she gets off him.) god well, we gotta go back and get them!"," honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?"
5461," okay, i’m never gonna wear them again. i just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.", y’know what? you can say goodbye to the tan ones.
5462, okay. (climbs back on his back.) all right., okay. (moves closer to the window.)
5463, bing! ho! and the bing-ette!," honey, you remember my boss doug right?"
5464," hi. so good news, the divorce is final. i signed the papers this a.m."," i didn’t know you and carol were getting divorced, i’m sorry."
5465," okay, i’ll see you tomorrow! (doug exits.) just so you know, we’re not seeing him tomorrow. (chandler wonders why.) i-i cannot spend another evening with that man. do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?  that’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party."," oh yeah. boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?"
5466,"bing! we’re all set for tonight, 8 o’clock."," oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. monica has to work."
5467," oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her mother work. fine. tomorrow night then.", oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.
5468, oh? why not?, it’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.
5469," what’s going on bing? does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?", well now-now you’re just talking crazy.
5470, so why can’t the three of us go out together?, because uh…we-we…we split up. monica and i split up. hold me.
5471," good god bing i…well i can’t say i’m altogether surprised, i saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. and the way she looked at me, pure lust.", y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. can i choke ya?
5472," bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this. now here’s the plan, grab your coat, we’re going to a strip club."," oh no-no-no, monica would freak. (doug looks at him.) but to hell with that bitch."
5473," oh bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. huh?"," oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl."
5474, bing—what’s this?! (grabs his hand.), it’s a hand. it’s a thing you use as a jack and coke holder.
5475," no, it’s a wedding ring. you gotta get rid of it. we’re gonna go to the east river right now and throw it in there!", oh no-no-no!
5476, ohh! (hugs him.) and i love spending time with you. (ross isn’t happy.), hi honey i’m home.
5477, from the tequila factory?," it was awful. to get out of going to dinner with doug i told him that you and i split up. so then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when i wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!"
5478, come here. i can breath through my mouth.," y’know what the worse part was? i got to see what my life would be like without you. it was like it’s a wonderful life with lap dances. please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives."
5479," i promise. hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?"," ooh, i don’t know if we’re there yet."
5480," hi. listen, i’m sorry about that whole thing with roger. it really wasn’t right, and i, and i want to make it up to you, so umm, i brought you something that i think you’ll really enjoy. (goes into the hallway and returns carrying the evander holyfield cutout.) now, this is just a loan. okay? i’m gonna, i’m gonna want him back. so… (looks at him longingly) i’m gonna go now. (exits.) (pause) (entering) i’m sorry, i thought i could do it and i can’t! (she grabs the cutout and exits for good.)  hey! i got you a present!!", oh my goodness! where did you hide it?
5481," i got it for your wedding and i ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!", pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang…
5482," oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom."," oh, okay."
5483, all right. (he goes to push it and it doesn’t move.), i kinda like it here.
5484, well i-i really don’t remember the name of it., well what did it do?
5485," well, you just—you put a quarter in and y’know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.", a vending machine?
5486, chandler! phoebe’s hogging the game!, who cares? it’s a stupid game.
5487, you only think it’s stupid because you suck at it., i don’t suck. it’s sucks. you suck.
5488," no! no-no! i love it! it is a great present! in fact, why don’t you go home and wait for the thank you card?", why do you want to play this game so bad?
5489, yes i am! again so simple!, you are not going to believe what i did today!
5490, well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving., i got good. i played this game all day and now i rule at it! they should change the name of it to ms. chandler. (pause) although i-i hope they don’t.
5491," wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played ms. pac-man while i went off to work like some kind of chump?!"," uh-huh, and i got all the top ten scores, i erased phoebe off the board! high five! (holds up his hand to give monica a high five, only he can’t straighten his fingers.)"
5492, what is the matter with your hand?," well i’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen up. come on, check out the scores. oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty words."
5493," chandler, why would you do that?", because it’s awesome.
5494, you think this is clever?," well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after a-s-s it is a bit of a challenge."
5495," hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty.", it is when you put it together with that one.
5496," ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting one of those from me. but ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can’t be there."," come on, he won’t even know what they mean."
5497, chandler! he’s seven; he’s not stupid., have you talked to him lately?
5498," all right, look i’m just gonna unplug it."," no-no-no, if you unplug it, i’ll have nothing to show for my day! it would be like i was at work. (she unplugs it.) no! (and plugs it back in.) hey look at that! look at that, it’s still there! this thing must have some kind of primitive rom (read only memory, it’s a memory chip.) chip in it or something!"
5499, honey you-you got to beat your scores!, with the claw?!
5500," all right fine. fine, i’ll do it. i’ve just got to get this off the screen. carol and susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.", (smiles) pull my finger—(looks at his hand)—my hand is messed up.
5501, chandler sucks! he couldn’t have gotten this good!, i did. (looks at his still deformed hand) but it came at a price.
5502, but ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this.," oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (they both look at him.) was it just me?!"
5503," oh my god phoebe, you’re on fire!", one more score to go! you can do it! (touches her shoulder.)
5504, don’t touch her!!, all right! go left! go left! go right!! go right!!
5505, (airily) hi.," are you, are you high?"
5506, i just had the most amazing bath., really? i don’t like baths.
5507," wait, you like them with me."," honey, it’s not the bath i enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady."
5508," oh, baths are so relaxing!", really? what do you do? you just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
5509," how dirty do you think i am? i’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! it would take all of your stress away.","honey, it’s 2:00 on a wednesday and i’m watching road rules, how stressed do you think i am?"
5510," (entering) hey, chandler, you got a minute? i-i really need to talk to you."," oh! uh, yeah! is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?"
5511," well, neither."," oh my god, what’s up?!"
5512," i don’t know. it’s-it’s just…lately, i’ve been feeling… okay, here’s what it is… (pause) you know what? i feel a lot better, thanks! (starts to leave)"," oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back."
5513," all right. okay. you and monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to london. oh, no, but that’s different. i mean, there are rules there, too! you know what i mean?", do you?
5514," it was different for you guys! i mean, i mean, you were both in the same place, right?"," in london?  yes. when monica and i were in london, we were both in london."
5515," you know what? this is a bad idea. forget it. forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.", if that.
5516," boy, do i have a surprise for you!", sex on the balcony?
5517," no, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?", what is it?
5518, i drew you a bath!," honey, i don’t like baths! could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?"
5519," please, could you just try it for me? come on, i used all my best stuff! i-i-i lit some candles. i put on some music. i used bath salts, plus bubble bath! and got you this little plastic navy ship. so it’s a boy bath!"," well, this does butch it up a bit."
5520," i swear, if you try it, you will love it!"," all right, if i do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?"
5521, bet i know how that discussion’s going to go.," (thinking) all right, this isn’t so bad. i like the flower smell! which is okay, because i’ve got my boat."
5522," (entering) so?  i told you you were a bath person! hey, when you get out, maybe i can give you a facial!", i’m going to need a bigger boat.
5523," (holding stomach) okay, a couple months late on the lecture, ross."," i’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? i think there’s something wrong."
5524, you know what? i-i think i’ll wait out here., i’m in the bathtub.
5525, oh. (she goes into the bathroom.) what’s wrong?," i drew my own bath, but i did it wrong! the water’s tepid. the salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. and the scents i used don’t compliment each other. eucalyptus and chamomile—oh!  the bath salts! they’re starting to effervesce! it’s different. (pause) it’s interesting."
5526," okay, let’s talk about something else."," yeah! sure, sure. so, what was going on with you today? oh-oh-oh!"
5527," well, i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey. he was talking about rules and right and wrong and…", i had the exact same conversation.
5528, you did? what was he talking about?, i don’t know! joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth!
5529, (groans) that was a long night.," all right, let’s break this down. what exactly did he say to you?"
5530," okay, he was talking about rules.  umm, and looking at people differently.", he didn’t say anything about that to me.
5531, what did he tell you?," he was asking all these questions about you, me, and london. and, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules."
5532," okay. so you, me and london. looking at people differently. maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone.", but what did he mean by rules?
5533, wait a minute! he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in!, because he was looking at her differently.
5534," and phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!", my god! he wants to do it with phoebe in london!
5535, just a minute! (to chandler) that’s mrs. tribbiani!, you don’t say anything.
5536," why would i say anything? that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! and they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?", i’m not going to let you say anything.
5537, you just stay here! (dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub)," oh, god!"
5538," yes, please.", do i smell essential oils?
5539," yeah, i’m going to take a bath. i’m just going to get a magazine.  what do you think you’re doing?", l-leaving my troubles behind?
5540," i know that you’re new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum."," oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed."
5541," fine, you can have the bath, but i am taking your boat. now you’re just a girl in a tub!", (upset) hey!
5542," hi, bubbles. manly. well, i just thought i would drop by and let you know how it went with joey.", (to monica) you told her?!
5543, we’re in the bathroom!, (sarcastically) because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!
5544," oh my god! a friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. it’s rachel!", you like rachel?!
5545, (from outside the bathroom) hello?, (sarcastically) yes we’re all in here and we would love for you to join us!
5546," oh, wow! yay! wow! hooray! oh, man!", i’ll…i’ll get you later!
5547," it sure is nice to do this together, isn’t it?", yeah. and what you’re doing feels so good.
5548, i’m not touching you., you’re not?
5549, it’s the salts.," oh, sweet lord. new realms of pleasure!"
5550, (laughs) no. (closes the door as chandler walks up.)," hey pheebs, what’s up?"
5551, you told me you hate massages!," buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning…don’t let phoebe in."
5552, okay—oop! too late! i’m leaving! come on chandler let’s go! (she storms out.)," well, phoebe i thought i’d—(off phoebe’s look)—yeah, what the hell. (exits with phoebe.)"
5553, whoa-hey-oh! sorry!, hey babe.
5554, hi honey. we just got a wedding gift from bob and faye bing; they don’t like us do they? (they gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.), who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? maybe we can take it back?
5555," no, it doesn’t say where it came from. where would we return it?", how about to the street say from the balcony?
5556, why don’t we just find a place for it?, okay. how about in that cabinet?
5557, no! that’s where we keep the canned goods! have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?, how about the closet by the bathroom? (the secret green door by the bathroom.)
5558," oh, okay. here, why don’t you let me do it?"," oh no-no-no, i will do it. honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (tries the door.) it’s locked, you have to help me. why is it locked?"
5559, no reason. i-i keep private things in there.," oh y’know, i’ve been living here a while and i’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. what is, what is in there?"
5560, feminine stuff., don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
5561," chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! if you love me you-you’ll let it go.", fine.
5562, thank you! (he tries the door again and monica glares at him.), (walking casually away) love you.
5563," (entering) hello chandler, lovely day huh? (to monica) you!"," phoebe if it helps alexandra has only been massaging monica for like three years. (phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and monica glares at him.) if! i said, ""if it helps!"" (goes to the bedroom.)"
5564, oh god phoebe!! (phoebe covers one ear.) oh that’s it! that’s it! right there! oh! (tries to cover the other ear.) ooooh-oooh-ooooh… (covers both ears and continues the massage with her elbows.), i wasn’t trying to open your closet! i wasn’t trying to open your closet! i swear! (running into the kitchen and sees its joey.)
5565," whoa, monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. what are you doing?", monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.  i don’t know! what could she possibly be hiding in here that i can’t see?!
5566," i don’t know. ooh, i bet it’s richard.", why would monica be keeping richard in here?
5567," well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and eating it too. you being the cake and richard being the too. or!", and here we go…
5568," oh uh, hey. not as good as this guy! (grabs ross around the shoulders.) he brought twizlers!", there has got to be a way!
5569," easy there captain kirk. oh, do you have a bobby pin?"," yeah. (checks his hair.) oh no wait, i’m not an nine-year-old girl."
5570, then why do you throw like one?, maybe monica has a bobby pin.
5571," sure. ""monica."""," so, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on rachel coming?"
5572," uh, really good. really good. yeah, i should be ready to kill myself any day now. (chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to joey.) wow, you sure found that quick. (he tries the pin in the lock.) i just—i wish i didn’t feel this way about rachel anymore, y’know? i wish things could go back to normal. i mean, i love living with her and god, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now i think…i think ross feels left out. y’know? when i had to take rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought i was the father. god… you should’ve seen the look on ross’s face. (pause) by the way, i have no idea what i’m doing here. for all i know i’m just locking it more. oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?"," that’s a good idea.  okay. (they switch places and chandler gets out a credit card.) so uh, ross is kinda bummed huh?"
5573," oh, i just…i feel terrible."," well, it’s not your fault. what are you gonna do? not take her to the hospital? y’know? you’re doing nothing wrong. (pause) except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (he loses his card behind the door.) richard? if-if you’re in there, could you pass me my credit card?"
5574, oh rach that’s great. that’s great. (they hug and joey breathes a sigh of relief.)," not to shabby, i got this all off myself…using my wife’s tools. (he takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what’s behind the green door! it is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) oh my god!"
5575, (entering) (gasps) how did you get in there?!, (laughs) you’re messy.
5576, oh no! you weren’t supposed to see this!, i married fred sanford!
5577," no chandler, you don’t understand! (chandler starts singing the theme for sanford and son, an old tv show starring redd fox.) okay! okay! okay! fine! now you know. okay? i’m y’know…i’m sick."," no, honey you’re not sick! look, i don’t love you because you’re organized, i love you in spite of that."
5578, really? you promise you won’t tell anyone?," yes! and look, now that i know if i got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet."
5579, well…it’s just umm…i’m afraid you might mess it up., so rachel’s all moved out huh? how are you taking it?
5580," well uh, i wanted to have a few beers, but uh, i got rid of those because rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. but i have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. and uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so it’s got a bit of a kick.", are you okay?
5581," thanks so much, pheebs! (to the dog) we are going to have so much fun, yes we are! (the dog sticks his head between joey’s legs) oh! not that kind of fun.", happy valentine’s!
5582," (from her bedroom) okay! i’ll be right out. i’m slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty."," (picking up a video from the table) ‘candy and cookie’. ‘candy and cookie?’ monica got me porn?! girl-on-girl porn?! she really must love me!! (chandler runs over to the tv, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some ""porn"")"
5583," yeah, just relax."," i love you, st. valentine.  woah, woah, that’s not pretty!"
5584, ow! ow! ooh! that hurts!," worst porn ever! worst porn ever! (chandler starts to press buttons on the remote control, frantically.)"
5585, ohhh! make it stop!, i am trying!
5586, (entering from her bedroom) so what do you think? (referring to her outfit)  (to herself) i’ve still got it!," (pointing at the video) why did you get me this?  it’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. oh, the dilating…"
5587," is this the video of the baby being born? sweetie, this is phoebe’s. why were you even watching it?", i thought…maybe…you got me porn for valentine’s day.
5588," chandler, if you thought i was going to get you porn for valentine’s day… (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! apparently, it’s about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer) oh, wait a minute. those aren’t stars. anyway, you want to take a look?"," well, i’m not really in a sexy mood right now."
5589," honey, what’s going on?"," well, remember the first time we saw jaws?"
5590, mm-hmm., how long it took to go back in the water?
5591," chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck valentine’s day!", you don’t know. you didn’t see it.
5592," child-birth, it’s a natural thing! it’s beautiful."," oh, beautiful? really? beautiful? you think this is beautiful? (picks up the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like he’s going to throw up!)"
5593," oh! oh, my god! no wonder my mother hates me!"," see, honey, there’s—(puts his hand on her leg)"
5594, how long has it been this time?,90 seconds.
5595,that’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all i did was think about it.," you know, it haunts me? up ‘til now, the worst thing i ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. after this, i would gladly make that my screensaver!"
5596," okay, well, we have to get past this! why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?", i can do that.  okay. now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.
5597," oh, thank god!"," oh, i know!"
5598," oh, my god."," poor ross.  oh, great. we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!"
5599," rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? it’s here."," oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it."
5600, why? you saw it? is it scary?," well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself."
5601," she’s right…of course not. honey, get the tape."," (with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) this reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down) okay, here we go."
5602," okay. (watching the tape) ooh, my! (rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) woah! why is that baby torturing that woman?!", why have i seen this thing three times?!
5603," oh, my god!"," wait, you guys, look!"
5604, what? did her ass explode?!," no, the baby’s out! look, look!"
5605," oh, look at those little fingers and toes!", and look how happy the mom is now!
5606," oh-oh! okay, she’s kicking!", oh! (puts his hand on her belly.) she’s growing inside you.
5607, whoa!!, oh! (pulls his hand away.)
5608, wow that was a big one., i think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
5609, (entering) oh hey you guys!, oh hey!
5610," uh-huh, (to chandler) and you?"," no. i mean i believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and i believe in falling in love, but soul mates, i don’t think they exist."
5611," okay, good.  well last night, i met monica’s.  yeah, i had a date with this guy, and i swear to god, he is her other half."," come on, don’t be crazy. (to rachel) you don’t think there’s someone out there better suited for monica than me, do ya? (rachel looks at him.)"
5612," of course, of course."," a tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!"
5613," oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet."," luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about."
5614," oh, i’m so sorry. um, and maybe i’m wrong! i but—y’know i’m gonna go out with him again, i’ll find out more.", you believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?
5615, (mouths to chandler) soul mate., (mouths to phoebe) what?
5616," that’s exactly what i said. phoebe, isn’t that strange.", what’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (everyone stares at him.) on a barbecue chicken pizza? (still there’s staring.) no?
5617," oh, i’d like a latte. oh y’know what? if you’re gonna talk about me, i’m gonna go with you.", what are you doing?!
5618, nothing! i swear to god i didn’t know you guys would be here! and the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. so…," i believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!"
5619, …so i’ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.," cheese you say? that’s some pretty smelly work, huh don?"
5620," well if you where ever enter the loire valley let me know, i’ve got a great little villa you can stay at.", is it made of cheese?
5621, i’d move in tomorrow!, (disgusted) oh come on! (to phoebe) are you listening to this?
5622, i’m so sorry., what do we do?
5623, i’d like to have don and phoebe over. wouldn’t that be nice?," sure, why don’t you set it up. i’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals."
5624, are you okay? you’ve been acting weird all afternoon.," yeah, fine. fine. not perfect!! but good enough."
5625, jeez! what is with you?," i’m sorry, did you say cheese?"
5626," all right, what’s going on?"," phoebe thinks you and don are soul mates, and i don’t believe in that kind of stuff. but then you two totally get along. so look, i won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with don and live in a house of cheese."
5627," chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?", no. but i’m sure (mimics don) ‘tomatoes’ does.
5628, i don’t believe in soul mates either., you don’t?
5629, no. i don’t think that you and i were destined to end up together. i think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. some days we work really hard., so you…you don’t want to live with don in a cheese house?
5630," no, i’ve had second thoughts about that. do you realize how hard that would be to clean?", i love you.  y’know what? i am going to take you out to dinner tonight. i found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (monica doesn’t look impressed.) no? really? they taste so good.
5631, is joey here?, i don’t see him. (to monica) do you see him?
5632," ew, was chandler naked? sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?", what?! no! no!
5633, i can’t! y’know? you guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.,"(incredulous) i don’t know what that’s like?! up until i was 25 i thought the only response to, ""i love you,"" was, ""oh crap!"""
5634, yeah. okay. (goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.) whoa! (stops.) i almost forgot this was on your…, (interrupting him) we didn’t play it!!
5635," okay, so when you’re done with your tea i’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.", i didn’t know you read tea leaves.
5636," well, i have been spending a lot of time in the lab.", what does yours say pheebs?
5637, great! great. then i must’ve left it at mona’s. i knew it!," well, i’m sure you get another one at ann taylor’s."
5638," (noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks i’ve been that guy everywhere i go. we take the same bus. we go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s the tea guy. (he gets up to leave, and smiles at phoebe.)"," phoebe, did you see that?! he totally checked you out! he is so cute! (looking at his tea.) mine has a picture of the village people, what does that mean?"
5639," so i thought joey and i would be okay once we hung out, but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore."," i know it’s tough now, but things will get better."
5640," how do you know that? what if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!"," i’m not great at the advice, can i interest you in a sarcastic comment? some cheese?"
5641," honey, what is the bruce springsteen cd in the kat stevens case?", let’s just say if i can’t find the right cd case i just put it in the nearest one.
5642," okay, where is the kat stevens cd?", in the james taylor case.
5643, where is the james taylor cd?,"honey, i’m gonna save you some time, 200 cds, not one of them in the right case."
5644," okay. no need to panic. deep breathes everyone. okay umm uh, we’re just gonna have to spend some time and put the cds in the right cases."," well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. y’know alphabetically or by genre?"
5645," good. (to chandler) uh honey, the miami vice soundtrack? really?", they were just giving those away at the store (off monica’s look) in exchange for money.
5646," it’s awfully pink. (ross mouths, ""it’s salmon!"")"," oh my god, honey we are so meant to be together. we both have copies of the annie soundtrack."
5647, oh it was perfect! i mean it really felt like he was my friend again., what problem did you tell him you had?
5648, all right. (gets up and walks out.)," (singing) the sun’ll come out…tomorrow! bet…your bottom dollar that tomorrow… (the girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) …there’ll be sun."
5649, (to joey) i can’t believe that you yelled at my boss! i’m-i’m gonna lose my job! what am i going to do?!, you can always sell your baby.
5650, it’s all gonna be okay. they’re just so happy that i’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. so long as i understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child i should bear.," wow, ralph lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business."
5651," chandler, can you give us a minute?"," oh i’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?  i’ll be in there. (goes into the bedroom.)"
5652," well, his name is parker and i met him at the drycleaners."," oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (sits up) who said that?"
5653," yes! every year ross makes the toast, and it’s always really moving, and always makes them cry. well this year i’m going to make them cry.", and you wonder why ross is their favorite?
5654,"oh i’m working on my toast for the party, or as i like to call it. sob fest 2002. hey check this out. (hands him a picture.)", it’s a dog.
5655, it’s a dead dog. that’s chi-chi; she died when i was in high school., it’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk about their dead pet?
5656," hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?"," yeah, sure. what do you need? we got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, (pause) and i think my testacles may be in here too."
5657," no, no, no wait! don’t tell me. let me guess. (points as he says their names) joey, monica, ross, rachel and, i’m sorry phoebe didn’t mention you. (chandler makes a face) chandler, i’m kidding all ready you’re my favorite!", ha!
5658," what a beautiful place. what a great night! i have to tell you, being here with all of you in event room c…i feel so lucky. i think of all the good times that have happened here. the birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! my god, i don’t want to forget this moment! it’s like i want to take a mental picture of you all! click! (he takes a mental picture of them all.)", i don’t think the flash went off.
5659, come on!, somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.

(joey nods his agreement.)
5663," oh, come on joey! you will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! and you deserve that! and if you do the interview you can mention, oh i don’t know, gal pal rachel green?", is that gal pal spelled l-o-s-e-r?

5739," yeah! yeah! i mean i’m sorry, i wish i can take everybody, but y’know chandler always supported my career. he’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.", so you’re never actually going to pay me back?
5740," it’s not just the stuff he paid for, i mean it’s-it’s everything. y’know? he read lines with me. he-he went with me on auditions when i was really nervous, and then he consoled me after i didn’t get parts that i really wanted. you always believed in me man. even, even when i didn’t believe in myself.", i always knew you were gonna make it. i’m so proud of you.
5741, (in a manly voice) i’m gonna go shave. (gets up.)," (in a manly voice) yeah well, i’m gonna go spit. (he goes into the bedroom. on his way out, joey gives rachel a wide berth.)"

5746, which part exactly?, the whole thing! can we go?
5747," oh no-no-no, give me some specifics."," i love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!"
5748," hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? did-did you like that part?", i was surprised to see a kangaroo in a world war i epic.
5749, you fell asleep!! there was no kangaroo! they didn’t take any of my suggestions! that’s for coming buddy. i’ll see you later. (starts to walk out.)," don’t go! i’m sorry. i’m so sorry!

5750, hey! sleeping beauty!, where have you been?! i tried to call you! i want to talk to you! i still feel so bad!
5751," (in a baby voice) oh no, were you upset? did you lose sleep?  uh-huh look, the only reason i can over here was to settle things between us! okay? you’ve done a lot for me and my career, i wanted to pay you back so i took you to the premiere but you missed it! okay, so how much do i owe you?  give me a number, i don’t want to owe you anything!"," you don’t owe me anything, i don’t want you money…"
5752," ah-ah-ah! we’re doing this! okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. right, how much were those?"," i don’t know, five hundred dollars?"
5753," okay, five hundred dollars. what else?"," well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots."
5754," okay, so that’s another five hundred. five hundred and five hundred, that’s… (pauses to figure it out.)", do you want a calculator?
5755, please!, here! (hands him one. joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)
5756," all right, what else?"," well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…"
5757, which we’re still keeping under our hats!, uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. which after twenty hours of lessons still came out jamaican.
5758," what the hell are you talking about, (in a jamaican accent) ""the south will rise again man."""," yes, money well spent!"
5759," yeah. okay, what else? rent!"," okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…"
5760," yes, i see that here. unfortunately we can’t guarantee a private room and currently they’re all unavailable."," man, if only you’d gotten here sooner. (ross turns and glares at him.)"
5761," umm, this is going to be fun. watch me freak out chandler. honey?  listen uh, i-i’ve been doing some thinking, and i don’t know whether it’s because we’re here or rachel’s giving birth but umm, i think we should try to have a baby.  (freaking out) what-what-what’s that now?!"," okay. i’ve been thinking about it too, and i, i think we’re ready."
5762, you’re ready to have a baby? my boy’s all grown up!, but you said you were ready too.
5763, yeah but i was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!," yes, but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?"
5764, oh good god! if you want a baby so bad just go steal it!  what is going on with you? since when are you so crazy about babies?," i’m not crazy about babies. i’m crazy about us.  look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. i’m not saying it has to be right now, but i’m starting to think that we can handle it. we’re good. we’re really good."
5765, we are pretty good., but nothing has to happen until your ready.
5766," well maybe i’m ready now. i mean, it’s a little scary, but maybe it’s right.", what?! it’s not right! we’re not ready to have a kid now!!
5767," so we’re gonna try? i mean, are we trying?"," we’re trying to get pregnant. (they start kissing, but chandler stops it.) y’know i’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. so, when do you want to start trying?"
5768," okay, hold on a sec.", period math?
5769," well, we could start trying. now.", right here?
5770," no, not here. maybe here."," wait a minute, it’s perfect. we got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!"
5771, i think we found a place., okay. (they start kissing.)
5772," umm, wait! do you want to set the mood a little?"," okay. uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights. (he goes to the light switch and finds it’s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) or turn them out all together. uh, no scented candles. okay here. here we go. (he sprays an aerosol air freshener above her.)"
5773," okay! okay! make me sterile, but okay.  okay. let’s hurry—oh wait! do we have a condom? (he looks at her.) oh right! (laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)","yes, 98.6. you’re gonna be fine."
5774, enter pheebs., should we tell rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?
5775," we could, or we can have sex in it."," well let me think about that, while i remove my pants!"
5776, (lying down on the bed) okay mister! fertilize me!  does that sound like janice?," if it’s not, then there’s two of them. and that would mean it’s the end of the world!"
5777, oh not bad. do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a saint bernard out your ass?, weirdest thing. did i hear—(a nurse opens the privacy screen and chandler sees janice)—mother of god it’s true!
5778, chandler bing!, jan-janice!
5779," oh, this should be easy. i have a very wide pelvis. you remember chandler.", janice i didn’t even know you were pregnant! who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?
5780, it’s you. this is yours.  (laughs) look how nervous he gets! we haven’t slept together in years! (laughs again.), that’s funny. does it-does it hurt? does the labor hurt?
5781," oh my god! she’s amazing. oh, oh i’m so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!","it’s incredible, i mean one minute she’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is."
5782, ohhh. (hands her back to rachel.)," so, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?"
5783," that’s not her name! i’m sorry, she just doesn’t feel like an isabella.", so then i guess ferdinad is out.
5784," yeah, i’ve had them picked out since i was fourteen."," oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?"
5785," yeah, but i love you more. besides y’know, nothing goes with bing. so i’m screwed. i mean… (rachel hands emma to monica.) oh, hi emma. yeah, that’s you. you’re our little em. oh what’s that honey? what? oh, you want a little cousin? (to chandler) you want a cousin right now?!  i know. hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? we may have just started a family. nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby."," and if not, we got to do it on a bucket."
5786, where’s my granddaughter? i’ve been practicing my magic tricks., he pulled a quarter out of my ear!
5787, so when do i get to meet emma and show her this? (pulls a bouquet of flowers out of his sleeve.), okay. wow.
5788," (taking chandler aside) hey chandler, can i talk to you for a second?  dude i just did something terrible.", that was you?! i thought it was jack!
5789," no! no, that was jack! rachel thinks i asked her to marry me!", what?! why does she think that?
5790, because it kinda looked like i did.," again, what?!"
5791," okay well, i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…", as we all are at some point during the day.
5792, it wasn’t my ring! it fell out of ross’s jacket! and when i knelt down to pick it up rachel thought i was proposing!, ross had a ring?! and he was gonna propose?  and you did it first?! this is gonna kill him! you know how much he loves to propose!
5793, i know! i know it’s awful.," well, what did she say?"
5794, (happily) she said yes., does ross know?
5795," oh god, what the hell am i going to tell him?", well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.
5796," oh, i like that. yeah…"," if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!"
5797, (laughs) now let’s not get carried away. (he walks away as monica comes over and hugs chandler from behind.)," honey, we’ve been over this. i need to be facing the other way."
5798," come on! come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. do you think that closet’s still available?"," i’m so tired. (she starts kissing him.) yeah okay, but no foreplay."
5799, well i’m peeking. (he peeks.) oh my god!," hello sir, you know monica."
5800, well i didn’t! i didn’t propose! (pause) unless uh… (pause) did i? i haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something i would do.," look, we can’t stay in here forever."
5801," oh, i still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! he didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!"," this is okay. we’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (they do so and find mr. geller leaning against a wall stunned.)"
5802, of course. i’ll always be your dad.," i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun."
5803, it wasn’t fun?!," (to monica) why? why-why-would you—wh-why… (to mr. geller) look, i just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want."
5804," well you gotta get at it princess! when your mother and i were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. that’s how i got my bad hip."," that’s funny, this conversation’s how i got the bullet hole in my head."
5805," but pleasure is important, (to chandler) and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. you up to the task sailor?"," seriously sir, my brains? all over the wall."
5806," no. no, i don’t. could you be a dear and go tell him?", you still haven’t told rachel you weren’t really proposing?
5807," no! she had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out."," joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! and what did it look like?!"
5808, i didn’t look at it. stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it., go and tell rachel right now before ross finds out.
5809," look, it’s not that easy. she said she wanted to marry me. i don’t want to hurt her."," okay, look, just do it gently."
5810, (looking at chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) so sexy. (waking him up.) honey., yea yea. (pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
5811, honey why don’t you go lie down.," no, no, ross and rachel will be back soon and then i gotta go to the office (pulls another balloon out of his mouth) am i producing them?"
5812, why’re you so tired?," couldn’t sleep last night you know, then i started worrying about this big divisional meeting that i have later today, the more i worried about it the more i couldn’t sleep.  y’know? i was like, if i fall asleep now i’ll get six hours sleep, but if i fall asleep now i’ll get five hours sleep. not matter what i did i couldn’t fall asleep."
5813," see this is what i was afraid of, i didn’t think i should be here either but somebody (looks at chandler) said he’d be over it by now."," hey, what do i know? i wanted to get a bigger gorilla."
5814," the numbers we are seeing new york, chicago, and london are consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields.  boston is down, atlanta is down, houston is down, i could go on and on but instead of boring you i’ll go straight to my forty two point plan.", walter (nods).
5815," ok if everyone’s on board, it’s settled, chandler, (walter puts his hand on chandlers hand, chandler sleeping puts his hand on top of his, he then wakes up and pulls his hand away) chandler?", yep.
5816, are you on board?, (not knowing what he’s saying yes to) yes.
5817," alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, okay?  that’s just what she wants.", (enters) hey.  monica can i talk to you outside for a minute?
5818, oh i’m kinda part of this., actually pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
5819, okay what’s up," umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to paris for a year? you know, you could study french cooking and i could write and we could take a picnic along the seine and go wine tasting in bordeaux?"

5845," nothing, huh?"," no, 'slim pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. they're looking for a cook. actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. they're looking for someone to shovel mesquite."

5852," well, if you really think about it, i mean four days is not that long. i mean, i see you monday before you go to work, and i see you thursday when you get back, and i always work late on tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. and well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.", i think you should take the job.  yeah. i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.

5915," uch, you see, i�m ovulating."," oh yeah, that�s what she says. but maybe you�re not ovulating at all, maybe it�s just a clever ruse to get me into bed."
5916," yes smokie, that is what it was. i just can�t get enough.", (to joey) you not gonna believe this: she lied! she tricked me into having sex with her.
5917," so? did have sex, right?", what�s the matter with me? why i�m such a girl?

5926, okay. (and she walks away)," what's with the word y'all? you know, just... two words just... pushed together... are we all allowed to do that, because if so, i say why stop there? you know, your new poodle could be your noodle. and fried chicken? could be fricken.waiter, waiter excuse me, i'll have the fricken?

5928," well, he did this bit... you probably had to be there, but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (phoebe bursts out in a laugh)", (to phoebe) were you there?
5929, you gotta be at least bi...," hey! (joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. chandler waits for joey to finish.) i need you to set me up for a joke. later, when monica is around, i need you to ask me about fire trucks."
5930, ooh. i-i don't know chan. i'm not so good with remembering lines.," (can't believe what he hears) well, thank god your livelihood doesn't depend on it."
5931," i know, right? (chandler has really big eyes, and nods) wh... wh... why are we doing this?", monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
5932, seriously? she actually said that?, yes! am i crazy to be this upset?
5933, nooooo! being funny is your thing!, yeah!
5934," without that, you just got ""lame with women""."," ye.... (stops because he realises what joey just said, and stares at him. at this moment monica enters)"

5936," uhm... rachel and i hired a male nanny. (joey makes a gesture and sound like ""can you believe that?"")"," you got a man who's a nanny...? you got a manny...? (monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. joey realises they also should laugh and punches ross. now all three of them laugh, but very fake. chandler seems happy again.)  you know, i don't mind a... male nanny, but i do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)"
5937," ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!"," if i'd known you guys were coming over, i would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)"
5938," okay, okay... chandler you... you stop it! (monica wipes away tears)", what is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)

5941," honey, listen... you have nothing to worry about with geoffrey.", oh yeah? is he funnier than me?
5942," well, you're... you're different funny... i mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks..."," i do limericks... uhm... there once was a man named chandler, whose wife made him die inside."
5943, (kind of emotional) i am learning so much from you.," well, i'm off to tulsa, so if your maitre d. friend has any funny oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com."
5944," honey, you can relax. last night at work, geoffrey told this really sexist joke. after that, not so funny anymore."," really...? see... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!"
5945," okay, don't miss that flight. you know i love you.", i love you too. (monica and chandler kiss. he turns to joey.) and... i like you as a friend. (they hug and pat each other on the back.)
5946, allright. see you later!, see ya! (he leaves the apartment)

5948, hey... hey listen... what do you guys know about investments?, how come?
5949," well, i just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. (realises that anyone could have overheard that) i didn't say that! it's in a bank guarded by robots!", do you have any ideas?
5950," (very excited) oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? richard!"," (imitating monica) oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? monica!"
5951, my dad told me. they play golf together.," oh, well... maybe i'll join them some time. i just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face."
5952, hi i'm joey. this is chandler., so how come richard's selling the place? went bankrupt? medical malpractice? choked on his own moustache?
5953," actually, he is buying a much bigger place. it's got a great view of central pa.....", mmm that's enough about you!
5954," all the appliances are included. there is a lot of light, a new kitchen... i think you guys would be very happy here... (joey and chandler both realise what she's assuming and start laughing.)"," no, no, no, no, no, no! no, no... we're not together. we're not a couple. we're definately not a couple."
5955," well, you seem pretty insulted by that. what? i'm not good enough for you?"," we're not gonna have this conversation again... look at this place. why am i so intimidated by this guy? pretentious art, this huge macho couch. when we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing monica to a real man! (laughs) you don't think he's here, do you? (joey looks around)"
5956," you know what it is? it's a nice place but i gotta see i don't know if i see myself living here. oh, oh, oh, let me see... (joey sits down on the couch, mimes opening a can and puts his hand down his pants) yeah, i could see it."," (chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by richard's video collection) look at these videos. you know, i mean, who does he think he is? magnum force, dirty harry, cool hand luke... oh my god!  there's a tape here with monica's name on it."
5957, ooh! a tape with a girls name on it. it's probably a sex tape... (realises) wait a minute... this says monica... (looks around) and this is richard's apartment... (realises some more), get there faster! (joey gasps and finally understands...)
5958, awesome!," i'm not gonna watch it... i don't need to watch it... i mean, what good could possibly come from watching? (sighs) well, we know i'm gonna watch it. (chandler moves to put the tape in the vcr and joey enters the apartment)"
5959," hey dude, what's up?"," don't judge me, i'm only human!"
5960, did you take that tape?," i had to! okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... wouldn't you need to know what was on it?"
5961, i don't know. who'm i'm married to?, some girl...!?
5962, she hot?, yeah...!?
5963, how did she get me to settle down?," allright, i'm gonna watch it... i mean look, it's probably not even what i think it is... and even if it is... it can't possibly be as bad as what i'm picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) can it?"
5964," guess i don't know. my experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... she doesn't say no to much else, i tell ya...", then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
5965, (backs off) what? whoo... what?," just for a few seconds, so i can know what it is... please?"
5966," all right, fine... but if i enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame... (chandler turns his back to the tv. joey puts the tape in the vcr, switches it on and watches what's on the tape... it's clearly a american football match, with the referee's whistle blowing, the crowds cheering...)", why am i hearing cheering?
5967," well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.", football? just football?
5968," yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing."," it's football... it's just football... this is great! this is the first time i've ever enjoyed football... it may be customary to get a beer... (chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the tv and a moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... joey's eyes double in size...) what the... (chandler turns around, but joey already took a sprint for chandler, jumps, and floors chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...) what are you doing?"
5969, so you stole that tape from richard's apartment?, whoho ho... listen to the judgement from the porn star!
5970, why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?," because that's who i am, okay? i'm sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches."
5971, is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?, this is about you and richard. he's clearly not over you. he keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
5972," isn't that sad? i mean, can you see how pathetic that is? you shouldn't be jealous. you should feel bad for him."," oh, yeah, well, poor richard. y'... i can grow a moustache!"
5973," chandler, this is not our problem. we've got each other. that's all that matters."," yeah, oh, but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air..."
5974, cowboy boots? i've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! (she turns on the video again)," oh, good, good. play more, 'cause i wanna see how it ends."
5975, that's not me!, what...? that's not you! life is good again! ride 'em cowgirl!
5976, that bastard taped over me! (chandler's expression changes), is that a problem?
5977," hey hon, could you help me get the plates down?"," yeah. hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?"
5978," no, i think we should save our china for something really special. like if the queen of england comes over."," honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint."
5979," what if something gets broken, they're so expensive.", what is the point of having them if we never use them?
5980," ok, but if something gets broken, and then the queen comes over..", i will explain it to her.
5981," next up is a marching band from muskogee, ok.", muskogee! that's like four hours from tulsa. woo hoo!
5982, yeah! i totally forgot i'm supposed to be there. i can't believe i forgot. i usually write stuff like this on my arm. oh! stupid long sleeves., what are you going to do?
5983,"i guess i'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why i wasn't there. the producers are going to be so mad at me. they sat us all down yesterday and said ""everyone has to be there at 6:00 am sharp, that means you tribbiani."" like.. like i was some kind of idiot.", well you proved them wrong.
5984, careful. <hands chandler a china plate> careful. careful!," i'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, i'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out.."
5985," i know, after you left the store, i chose different ones.  well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me."," oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?"
5986," well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want monica and chandler.", i can't believe you'd want us to raise emma.
5987, connected? i mean.. to what? she's.. she's  a lump.," you know, guys i got to say. this means so much to me. that you would trust me with your child. i mean, we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own. you know i've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>"
5988," okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do i get the baby?"," no, if crazy plate lad.. <sees monica frustrated at this comment> if monica dies then i would get emma, right?"
5989, well actually..., actually what?
5990, uh.. who has to die for me to get her?," so if monica's not around, then i'm not good enough to raise emma?"
5991, yeah he's lying. he looked down., well what is wrong with me? am i .. am i incomptent? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
5992, no you're all about the fun.," look, i may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think i'm not capable?"
5993," no, you both are equally capable. its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.", ok. so if we both had emma and i die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.
5994," i lie better then that, right?"," so.. let me get this straight. so my two friends die, i get emma. then my wife dies, then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?"
5995, hey. there you are. you disappeared after dinner., oh? did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly?
5996, ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about. i mean its not like their so responsible. emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five year old condom.," yeah but they're right. i mean, i'm not a strong father figure and i never will be."
5997, no you learn these things. you grow into it.," yeah, but its not who i am. everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid. and its true. and look everybody knows it."
5998, i don't know it! i want to have a kid with you because i think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.," oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""go to your room! you're grounded""?"
5999," can you hear me say ""you're grounded""?", you said that to me last week.
6000," hey dude, you okay? sorry about before."," oh no thats okay, you're totally right. i don't know anything about disciplining a child. but it did hurt my feelings and i want you to know that when i die, you don't get joey."
6001, ew! gross.," alright! that is it. this is our apartment and you can not behave this way. now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out, but they're very important to monica. i want you to apologize to her right now."
6002," mon, i'm so sorry.", okay. thats better. now i want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
6003, sorry.," by the way, that fight was totally arousing."
6004," dude. well done. you know what? if i die, and rachel dies and monica dies then you can totally take care of emma.", oh yeah? well thanks.
6005," so, so now do i get joey?"," okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose."
6006, she needs changing.," oh no no no.. i'll get her. i'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise emma. i'll be right there emma. just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> well.. what do you know? i guess, i'll be the one who dies first."
6007," hey, does monica know about her broken plates yet?", nope...
6008," broke them all, huh?", yep...
6009, you gonna tell her?," nope... (monica walks in) hey... so i'm gonna... put the plates back. you know, i think you were right, i don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time."
6010, like only if the queen comes?, maybe not even then. (joey walks in)
6011," this kitty is mittens and this one is fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is jinkies.", yep.� that's a lot of cats jo lynn.� single are ya?  chandler bing.
6012, hey.� how come you're answering your own phone?� where's your crazy assistant?, what's up joe?
6013," okay, what have we always wanted to do together?", braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
6014," no, no, no.� when you get home tomorrow night, you and i are going to be at the wizzards-knicks game . . .� courtside!", courtside?� oh my god.
6015, yeah.� maybe michael jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee., that's so cool.� i'll let monica know.
6016, hello?, joey just called.� he's got courtside knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
6017," really?� but tomorrow night is the only night i get off from the restaurant.� if you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week."," but hey, it's courtside.� the cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . (pause)� that's not the way to convince you."
6018," chandler look, i don't want to be one of those wives who says, ""you can't go to the game.� you have to spend time with me.""� so, if you could just realize it on your own . . ."," i know.� you're right.� i want to see you too.� i've just got to figure out a way to tell joey, you know?� he's really looking forward to this."
6019, tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.� tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.� tell him that what little time we have is precious.," yeah, ah, ah . . .� i'll think of something."
6020, welcome home.," (hangs his jacket over the suitcase, locks the door, then turns to monica.)� oh well, look at you."
6021, yeah.� what do you think?," well, it looks great.� it's just that . . . well, i'm wearing the same thing underneath.� so . . .  see what i mean . . . (they kiss.)"
6022, just a second.," (hushed) no, no, no, no, no.� joey can't know that i'm here."
6023, why not?," because i didn't know how to tell him that i couldn't go to the knicks game.� so, i just told him that i had to stay in tulsa."
6024," so, you lied to him?", achhh.� it's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.� (pause)� except with you.
6025," because. . .� one of them is for you.  cheers.� (she clinks his glass and pulls back.)� okay, buh-bye.� (she closes the door.)"," you know, it's funny.� i've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself.� (he raises his hands in front of himself, sticks out his behind, and wiggles it.)� hi ya."
6026, you might want to keep practicing.," yah.  it's joey.� (he answers it, holding it out so that monica can hear too.)� hey joe."
6027," dude, come home!", what? why?
6028, come . . .� home.," look i, i can't.� what's going on?"
6029," i don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . i think monica's cheatin' on ya.� i told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.  all right look.� (he walks to the hallway.)� if you can't come home and deal with this, then i'm gonna.", no!
6030, (outside the apartment door) i just heard him!, (softly) can you . . . hear him . . . now?
6031," (listens at the door.)� no.� (pause) all right, i'm going in.", no! wait!
6032, i heard him again!," (writhes as if in agony) all right, look.� just stay there.� i'm coming home."
6033, okay.� great.� i'll see you when you get here.� i'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out., is that really necessary?
6034," chandler, you have to tell joey that you're not in tulsa."," don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that i'm cheating on him?� (monica tips her head slightly as if asking ""did you hear yourself?"")� i heard it."
6035, i don't want him to think that i'm having an affair., all right.� i've got a plan.� i'll go down the fire escape.
6036," yes, because all good plans start with, ""i'll go down the fire escape."""," hear me out woman.� i'll go down the fire escape.� then, i'll wait for a while.� then, when i come up the stairs, it'll be just like i just got back from tulsa.� then, joey and i will come in and see that there's no guy in here."
6037, aren't you afraid that joey's going to figure all of this out?� (pause)� i heard it., i'm just going to wait for a little while.
6038, scary pigeon's back?, it's huge.
6039," wow!� that didn't take long.� i thought you said tulsa was, like a three hour flight."," (pause) well, you're forgetting about the time difference."
6040, (gasp) chandler!� you're home!," that's right.� you're husband's home.� so, now the sex can stop."
6041, what are you saying?, joey said that you're in here with another man.
6042," all right.� all right.� then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?� (he checks the bathroom shaking the bat.� then he proceeds to their bedroom.)� bwa-ah-ah!", (to monica) what is he doing?
6043," (emerging) bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows."," all right.� well, i'll check the guest room."
6044, (sniffs his shirt.)� oh yeah.� i rubbed a magazine on myself earlier., there's nobody here joe.
6045," (spots the suitcase just inside the door where chandler left it) whoa, whoa.� wait a minute.� wait a minute.� if you just got back from tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?"," (thinks, then turns to monica) i climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?"
6046, what's going on?," i'm sorry.� i, i told you i was in tulsa because i wanted to spend the night with monica and i, i didn't know . . .� i didn't think you'd understand."
6047, i don't know what to say.� we shouldn't have lied to you., yeah.� i feel so bad.� is there anything i can do to make it up to you?
6048," (pause) yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though i know you said you couldn't.� but then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.", i'm sorry. �that's the one thing i can't do.� i promised i'd be with monica.
6049, (taps chandler on the arm) you can go.  you should go to the game.� it's okay.� i want you to., really?� you're gonna be okay?
6050," yeah, i'll be fine.� you know, maybe i'll stay here and practice the art of seduction."," you're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?"
6051, it's gonna be so hot!� (she kisses him.)," okay, bye."
6052, thanks.� (joey and chandler exit to the hall.� joey pulls out the tickets and hands one to chandler.)� here's your ticket.," hey, listen.� i'm never going to lie to you again, okay?� and i want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid."
6053, thanks man.  where are you going?, game's tomorrow night joe.
6054, (smiling) uh-huh.," (coming from the bedroom) say goodbye elves, i'm off to tulsa."
6055, you're really not coming back?," yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. if i don't get it done, i'll be fired."
6056," it's so unfair, you don't even like your job!"," so, who does?"
6057, i can't get *enough* dinosaurs!," i'm sorry, i won't be here."
6058," it's just... it's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, i understand.", thanks. (they kiss) i'll see you new year's day.
6059, (shocked) you're not gonna be here new year's eve??," did i not mention that?  (thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:) and to all a good night! (and runs out of the apartment)  all right everybody, i know that it's christmas eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing ""screw you, mr. bing!"" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- by the way, you can all call me chandler."
6060," i was, uh, checking out that insurance company's christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and i just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- so i stole ther ham. (she turns the cardboard box upside down over the conference table, a big piece of ham falls out.)"," (to the others) you hear that? you may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
6061, my kid's in a play right now.," y'know what, i know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) i had a little talk with the boys in new york, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little christmas bonus may be in order."
6062," (reading off his card) ""a donation has been made in your name to the new york city ballet""."," well, that's like money in your pocket! - alright look, you want me to say it? this sucks. being here sucks! this work sucks!"
6063, *now* it feels like christmas.," i'm sorry. hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. i have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. and then tomorrow morning, you get to have christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
6064, you can come to my house!," haha, no thanks!"
6065, that was a nice pep-talk.," oh, thanks! i'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
6066," so, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?"," typical christmas-y stuff, you know? our holidays are pretty traditional..."
6067," okay, pheebs, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet."," i can save you time ladies, i'm right here."
6068," yeah, chandler why don't you take a walk? this doesn't concern you."," what? that's terrible!  oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
6069," don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to joey's and search, ok?"," no not okay, you can't look for monica's presents!"
6070," oh no, we have to!"," no, you don't have to, and you can't because i, i live here too."
6071," chandler, that's not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you've just gotten her one great present? i mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?"," if i help, we can find 'em faster!"
6072," no, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."," ok, pheebs, your turn."
6073, you got me a cola drink?," and, a lemon lime."
6074," well this, this is too much, i feel like i should get you another sweater.", and last but not least.
6075, cool!  santa! (runs to chandler and hugs him)," well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
6076," thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.  because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.", but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
6077," yeah, is that okay?"," then it's okaaay! (they kiss.)  you know what, everybody? go home. you should be with your families. it's bad enough that we're working new year's eve.  did i not tell *anyone* about new year's eve? -- alright, look, go! go home, okay? merry christmas! go.  good, god's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees wendy) you're not gonna go?"
6078, naah... i couldn't leave you alone., ah. thanks.
6079," besides, i can't leave until their christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.", ah. (the phone rings; he answers it) chandler bing.
6080, (simultaneous to the others) ble-blah-blar blargh!," ahh, merry christmas; i miss you guys!"
6081, so is it horrible? is everybody working really hard?," ah, well no, it's just uh, me and wendy."
6082, wendy? -- that sounds like a girl's name., it is. did i... not tell you about her?
6083," umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about new year's eve. where is everybody else?", i sent them home.
6084," ohh, you are such a good boss! is she pretty?"," uhh, uh..."
6085," (in a low voice) answer faster, answer faster!", i don't know!
6086," (in the same low voice) answer better, answer better!"," i don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague."
6087, what does she do there?," oh, she's regional vice president; she's... just below me."
6088, she did what?, be-low me!
6089, *what*??," well, she... she didn't win..."
6090," alright, well, maybe i should let you and the second prettiest girl in oklahoma get back to work."," well, second prettiest that year; i mean, of *all* the girls in oklahoma, she's probably..."
6091," (interrupting him) oh chandler, stop talking!"," honey, there's really nothing to worry about.  i'm serious!  merry christmas."
6092, merry christmas.," merry christmas, you guys!"
6093," (simultaneous to the others) blah blargah, blar-blab."," (hanging up the phone) the wife says ""hi!""."
6094, ah. fun conversation?," ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and i are alone, that something is gonna happen."
6095," huh? really? -- hm, that'd be so terrible? (she gets hold of chandler's tie, slowly moving her hands upwards on the tie, getting closer and closer to him, seductive.)"," this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.  whoa-ho, back off, missy! (he takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)"
6096, (laughs) ...missy?, i don't know; i'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (she lets go of his tie) wait a minute... am i sexy in oklahoma?
6097," you are to me... (she gets closer again, putting her arms around his torso.)"," (flattered) no,... no... (realizing) no! (he quickly gets several steps away from her.) look, i'm, i'm married!"
6098, so? i'm married. (showing him the ring on her finger.), i'm *happily* married.
6099, oh. - what's *that* like?," right. so, i'm sorry..."
6100," seriously? happily married. so that phone call before, that was ... happy?"," well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. she's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... you know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. but, what i have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us."
6101," okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending christmas with me?"," i mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!  you kidding? you're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (she jumps up and kisses him.) (breaking the kiss.) whoa! whoa! whoa! what's going on? you and i just made out! you and i are making out?  but we don't do that."
6102, drunk enough that i know i wanna do this. not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage., (thinks) that's the perfect amount!
6103," eh, we weren't that close anyway!", eh! (they start making out again)
6104," well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not just goof around with him."," y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am *so* bad at this.  really? okay, so..."
6105," yeah. (they kiss and as she starts to leave, chandler starts to dance. without turning around:) don't do the dance.  i can't get married until i get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.  no-no-no, wait! we need something old!"," oh, okay, i have condom in my wallet that i've had since i was twelve.  (looks around) here just...take this. (hands her the sweater.)"
6106," listen umm, i've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that."," look, i thought about it too, and i'm sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.  yeah, i'm putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
6107," oh, you're so sweet. (they hug and kiss.) oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"," eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y'know? we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.  well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old."
6108," hey-heeyyy - look at that, it's a christmas miracle!", i wanted to be with you. i missed you so much.
6109," hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?", monica.
6110, got ya. (blinks an eye), i never want to leave you again!
6111," but i thought if you left, you get fired.", turns out they can't fire me. because i quit.
6112," what, you, you really quit your job?"," yeah! it's a stupid job, and i could not stand leaving you. and why should i be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?"
6113, what do you really want to do?," (realizing) i have *not* thought this through!  i know, i, i should have talked to you first about it."
6114," no, i think that this is what you wanna do, i think it's great!", thanks!
6115," chandler, your being here is the best christmas present i could have ever imagined.", (flattered) ahh...
6116, now give me my real gift.  (to chandler) thank you.," (to monica) here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)"
6117, wha... are you kidding? i can't return this.," i... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. besides, this gift still says i love you guys."
6118, mine's is to lilian myers.," i don't have a *job*!  actuary... no. book-keeper... no. topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to monica:) hey, d'you know what i just realized? you are the sole wage earner. *you* are the head of the household. i don't do anything - i'm a kept man!"
6119," you are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to chandler) hey, here's twenty bucks. -- why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while i'm at work tomorrow?  good morning, tiger! i'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. you're gonna get me good and pregnant.", i've got nowhere to go this morning. i'm unemployed! i don't know what i'm gonna do with my life.
6120," well, i just lost my erection."," i mean, what am i supposed to do with myself?"
6121, you're supposed to find your passion in life. you can be whatever you wanna be now. it's exciting., but it's all so overwhelming. i don't know where to start.
6122," hey, wait a second. i can help you with this. you just need to be organized. we can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. there could be folders and files!", hey! this is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
6123," (flipping through bunch of folders as chandler enters from bathroom) okay, i have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.", how long was i in there?
6124, okay. let us start with the a's. advertising., wait. advertising! that's a great idea!
6125, don't you want to look through the rest?," i don't think i have to hear the rest. advertising makes perfect sense. sorry you had to waste all this time, though."
6126," you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? ooh, now i get to use my shredder!"," i mean, i can write slogans. i mean, how hard can it be, right? ""cheese. it's milk that you chew."" ""crackers. because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""a grape. because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"""
6127," i got one. ""socks. because your family's feet deserve the best.""", honey? leave it to the pros.
6128, i actually know someone in advertising. i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. maybe i can get him to meet you? give me the phone.," ""the phone. bringing you closer to people...who have phones."""
6129," so, do you have any other question about advertising?"," no, no. but let me show you what i can do. ""bagels and donuts. round food for every mood."""
6130, monica warned me you might do that. i actually think we might have something for you at the agency., really? that's great!
6131, it's an unpaid internship.," it's funny. when you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid."""
6132, come on now. monica has a good job. and it's not like you have a family to support.," actually, we're trying, and i don't think monica's gonna wanna postpone it. we're supposed to have sex tonight. actually, she's probably at home naked right now. i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. i can just picture her on the bed right now."
6133, you're pretty.," whatever i decide to do, i'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. it's gonna be a while before i make a living at it. maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family."
6134," (enters) okay, it's baby time. pants off bing. (sees ross) didn't see you there geller."," yeah, ross is here so..."
6135, you have a blue tie that would go with this? emma spit up on mine.," oh, yeah. but you have to give it back if i get a job. of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits."
6136, (to ross) sorry. (to chandler) but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.," oh god, i have to tell you something. you're not pregnant.  that thing that i have to do to make a baby. i faked it."
6137, you faked it? you couldn't have faked it!, oh yes you can. you just make the faces and the noises.
6138," guys can fake it? unbelievable. the one thing that's ours! besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?"," that's actually why. look, i'm starting a whole new career now, and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby, i'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while."
6139, like a month?, or a year?
6140," really, you want to wait a year?"," it could be less than a year. i mean, you've heard my stuff. ""pants. like shorts, but longer."" (pause) it'll probably be more than a year."
6141, i really wanna have a baby.," yeah, me too. look, i'll just get my old job back."
6142," no, i want you to have a job that you love. not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.", i quit and you learn what i do?
6143," it's just, i think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. i mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. there's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but i think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.", i guess. it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
6144," it's gonna be really scary. i mean, god. when we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. i mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, i won't have time to clean it. what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? messes up all the ribbons?! what if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? where will all the ribbons go!?!", should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
6145," yes, please!"," oh, and i promise, i will not fake it this time."
6146, what about my children drake?! huh!? (she starts running around on the set with a security guy chasing her) no!! no!! no! god!, hey
6147, hey. so where's mon?," oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for rachel's birthday party tonight."
6148, and you're not helping?," i tried, but apparantly singing ""i will survive"" in a helium voice - not helping."
6149," oh, wow, molly is just great!"," yes, bravo on the hot nanny."
6150, what? you really think she's hot?, are you kidding? if i wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
6151, thank you! (goes to get coffee), now that rachel's gone?
6152, would you stop staring at her?, i wasn't staring. i was leering.
6153," yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. you know, when it's right there in your face. me, i like to have to work to find someone attractive. makes me feel like i earned it.", looks like joey is doing allright with her.
6154, whazzup??,"seriously dude, 3 years ago."
6155," listen, can you do me a favor? i'm gonna be out today. can you just keep an eye on joey, make sure nothing happens between him and molly?", you don't trust him?
6156," wh - no. some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the ""hot nanny""."," is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? because i could get a job any day now."
6157," you do appear right on the cusp of something. come on man, i'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?"," allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it."
6158," well we gotta do something, ok? nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause)", picturing that tree?
6159," i am, yes."," where you going, joe?"
6160, for a walk., oh. you mind if i join you?
6161," actually, that will be long. you know, i really need to organize my thoughts.", your thoughts? plural?
6162," allright, fine, i only have one thought! it's about the hot nanny, i gotta see her!"," i'm afraid i can't let you do that, joe."
6163," now you're telling me i can't see her?? you guys are killing me! she's forbidden fruit! it's like ... like she's the princess and i'm the stable boy ... why are you doing this, huh? did ross tell you not to let me go over there?"," yes, as a matter of fact he did, so i can't let you go."
6164, huh. interesting. now there are obstacles. hot nanny and me against the world. this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of., great novels?
6165, where the hell are joey and molly? i asked you to watch them.," (in a helium voice, holding a balloon) i'm sorry, i got a little occupied."
6166, we have to stop them before something happens!," (still helium voice) right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the door)"
6167," see? why, gavin, why? right when i'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)"," (sings in a helium voice) first i was afraid, i was petrified (very happy)"
6168, (walks in) hey, (normal voice) hi
6169," listen, i think i've left something here."," oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). this is yours?"
6170," (likes the jacket) no, but i like it. i think i left one of my rat babies."," oh, uh, well, i haven't seem it but if i do i'll let you know."
6171, yeah! yeah! ok! sure! look! can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?, sure! just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! do you believe that who ever did something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...i mean come on!!
6172, ok you...you really don't know what i am talking about?  ok! last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.," our balcony? seriously? that's so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony. and she said ""no, no. it's too cold, nobody will go out there."" and i said ""maybe if we put some light out there they will”"
6173," right that's why i came over to talk about. hum...i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony, even though there were no lights !", so are you gonna...talk to her?
6174," why...why should i? i mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!"," you know when ""that's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!"
6175," no i'm serious. i mean she wants to date people? fine! i don't care but...at least she could have told me. you know i...i've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows, then so will i ! very funny! ross is gay! ah! ah!", no no no. good. so you're moving on? do you have any idea where you're moving?
6176," i don't know. i mean i have plenty of opportunity. just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me. and then the other day on the subway a woman ""accidentally"" sat on my hand."," dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!"
6177," well, and how about this? there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental potluck dinner.", why did i get married?!
6178, please i have an extremely high threshold...holly mother of god! my face! my face!! i'm all right! i'm all right! just a little bit of shock that's all but i'll be fine you can go again. i'm ok, hey it's the most eligible man in ny. how's the moving on going?
6179, not well. i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.," well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. you know i mean think about it. single white male, divorced three times, two illegitimate children. the personal ad writes itself…."
6180, that's funny...do you think you'll ever work again?, what are doing? you know i can only dish it out!
6181, i can't believe rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me," maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing"
6182," no no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.", did she go out with him?
6183," no. when he called, i...i threw the message away.", ah! the high road...
6184, you know what? enough! enough talking! i have to get moving! hey check out those two blondes over there! hey come with me!, are you trying to get everybody divorced?
6185," you don't have to do anything. it will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? you...you break the ice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and i swoop in with some interesting conversation, so they'll see that i'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one…", i thought i had to make the jokes!
6186, don't you have to be at work?," oh come on! hello! hi! my name is chandler, here's my friend ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. we only need six more people for a human pyramid...swoop!! swoop!!"
6187, sorry...we were just leaving, we still got it!
6188," right, so that's a firm ""no"". i cannot believe this, i just keep striking out."," i don't get it neither, i mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed"
6189, this is great. rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and i'm gonna die alone., by drowning or...?!
6190," all i ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. i mean, am i so unlovable?", well...
6191," hey, i need your help."," wow, it seems serious. what seems to be the problem, ashley judd?"
6192," look, i'll get new headshot taken, all right, so i want to get my eyebrows shaped"," i am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!"
6193," you may be a sissy but i'll still (pound you out on ground). all right, it hurts so bad, i could only let her do one eyebrow and now... they don�t match!", it�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
6194," all right, look, you got to help me out, ok? look, i have the magic marker, i want you to fill in the skinny one so i don�t look stupid for my pictures."," ok. first of all, this is green!"
6195, what the hell am i supposed to do!," all right, i will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what i am about to tell you."
6196," what, what."," ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well i earned mine by plucking the eyebrows of my father and his �business� partners."
6197, oh my god!," yeah, well, i guess you don�t need my help victor victoria!"
6198," ok all right, no, no, no, no, i do, i do, i do, i need your help, but chandler i don�t know if i can take anymore plucking. it hurts so bad!"," oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle self-loathing touch."
6199, this is your daughter? i can be your new mummy!, and done!
6200," oh my god! i didn�t feel a thing ! hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around that sadistic bitch at the saloon", thanks. you wanna see what it looks like?
6201," yeah, yeah. hey, they totally match! they look great! they look great! how you doing!"," yeah, yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little worried i was uncovering a birthmark right about there, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate."
6202, thank you so much., no problem.
6203, oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands., i am sorry i am late. you�ll understand when you�ll see joey.
6204," honey, you�re just in time, i�m about to sing another song!", really? in front of all this people?
6205, and they love me!, oh my god!
6206," all right, watch!  ""tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. give in this time and show me some affection…""", are those my wife�s nipples?
6207," oh? isn�t that funny? i didn't see that before, i wouldn't have let her go up again.", i gotta stop this.
6208," oh, who cares, they still love me! ""i am so excited..."""," you, touching yourself, out!"
6209," ha, oh, of course.  your eyebrows look weird."," �jeremiah was a bullfrog. was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but i helped him drink his wine.� so you just touch yourself for anything?"
6210," you guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?"," see, now, why would you assume that? just because we're married? i will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. now, if you'll excuse me, i have to get back to reading the obituaries."
6211," well, phoebe set me up on a date.", wow.
6212," what, slept together a year and a half ago? yeah, i'm all set."," well, i think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? i mean, it sounds healthy. i mean, you have needs. embrace your womanhood!"
6213," no, i think we killed it."," emma? emma? look at me! well, i think i'll go downstairs for a while.  no, no, no, no! no, no, no, no! it's okay, it's okay. i didn't go. don't cry, it's just a bit! i'm your uncle chandler; funny is all i have!"
6214,"okay, just so you know, i'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours."," i don't do that.  i'll try to stop. wait, did you say until the sixth?  today is the sixth."
6215," no, it's not.","yes, it's also 2003."
6216, oh my god. today's the sixth?! i may be done ovulating! i may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant., it's okay. go take the test and see if we're okay.  tough crib.
6217," hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? there's only one here.", i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times.  i am not working. there's not much to do around here!
6218, we're okay. i'm still ovulating.," oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, i am not."
6219," so, let's do this.", i - i don't think i can.
6220," come on. i know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.", because of emma.
6221," oh my god, emma. oh, sweetie, i forgot you were here. oh, you're right, we can't do this. we can't leave her alone.  unless... maybe we do it here. i mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?"," well, she's aware when we leave the room. she may notice if we start... canoodling in it."
6222, canoodling?," well, i can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the b-a-b-y."
6223," i don't know. i mean, i guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...", horrifying? scarring? something people go to jail for?
6224, i guess you're right.," you guess i'm right? when we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window."
6225, she's asleep. chandler?, emma was doing it!
6226, she's asleep.," ooh, she's asleep, that means we can..."
6227," well, that was weird. you were loud, and i was fast.", i think we may have really done it this time.
6228," oh, i wish i didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.", you may wanna get some more of those too.  where's emma?
6229," oh my god, where's emma? where's emma?"," don't ask me, i was in there canoodling you!"
6230," okay, okay, i'm sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma. you go look across the hall, and i'll call her cell.", okay. (runs out.)
6231, don't you lie to me! i could tell by chandler's hair. (to chandler.) you are so lazy. can't you get on top for once?," all right, all right, we were. we were trying to make a baby. monica's ovulating."
6232," unless you name your firstborn child joey.  hey, i may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.", your family name is tribbiani.
6233, i have such fat hands!," (excited) guys, guys, i've got great news! guess what…"
6234, what's your news?, thank you. i got a job in advertising. (everybody cheers)
6235," (inquisitive) gosh, what's the pay like? (everybody stares at her indignantly) oh, come on people… (defending) come on, now, if i don't know who makes the most, how do i know who i like the most! (she looks at joey) hey joey! (joey winks at her)"," actually, it pays nothing. it's an internship."
6236," oh, that's cool. we have interns at 'days of our lives'."," right. so, it'll be the same except… less sex with you. (joey nods)"
6237," so, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?"," well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like."
6238, (enthusiastic) that's great.," yeah, i mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating  (grinning awkwardly) humiliating and noble!"
6239, (sitting down) don't make me more nervous than i already am!," (entering) good morning, everybody."
6240," can i get you a cup of coffee, sir?"," oh, no, no, i'm an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that i can rent a car."
6241," seriously, you're an intern?"," yeah, well, i'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom."
6242, (shaking his head disbelievingly) dude!," right. look, i know i'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like i'm bob hope (he sits down)  the comedian? uso?!"
6243, so far so good! (joey nods)," (entering, carrying a large box) honey, i'm old!"
6244," (standing up, walking towards him) what's wrong?", i am so much older than these other interns. i can't compete with them.
6245, so you're a little older. try to look at the positive: you have all this life experience.," yes, but i don't think life experience with these. (he opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)"
6246, what are they? (they sit down again), they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
6247,(determined) i give you $ 500 for them!, what am i supposed to do with these?
6248," ah, come on, sneakers are easy. you wear sneakers all the time."," well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and i think i heard somebody say ""slorps"". (he takes a sneaker) and here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! (to monica) would you help me try to sell these?"
6249," okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?"," no, i don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for."
6250, what are you doing?," putting on the sneakers… thought i'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…"
6251," oh, anything yet?"," yes, how's this: they're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!"
6252, we gotta get more of that. (he leaves the apartment), (sitting on the couch) you know what… these aren't half-bad! (to rachel) you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren.
6253," okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, i'm not allowed to talk to ralph."," alright (he stands wearing the sneakers on) i feel youger already!  (on the floor) yah, i think i broke my hip."
6254, (ironic) that's interesting! just one thought: you didn't mention the shoes. who's next? (chandler raises his hand) chander…, okay… (he stands up) you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. he's about my age…
6255, (snorting) your age?," a-huh. so he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. he jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: ""not suitable for adults!"""
6256," chandler, that's great!"," oh, thank you, sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me (he sits down again)"
6257," you see? that has a clear selling point. it appeals to our key demographic, it's…. (enthusiastic) you did you come up with that?"," (over-enthusiastic) i don't know, i don' i don' know! i was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow."
6258, that is great. good work!  see all of you tomorrow. (he leaves), the cold weather hurts my hip!
6259, great. thanks! (he leaves), did you see our bank statement? can this be right?
6260, i know...god. i haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed oreos. what happened to all our money?," i'm not sure what they did, but i'm inclined to blame enron."
6261," i guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.", maybe i should quit and get a job that pays.
6262," oh, but you're finally doing something that you love! i can't ask you to give that up. though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.", you know what? you know what? i think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. and maybe we start eating out of joey's refrigerator for a change. you're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
6263, ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents., no! we're not borrowing money.  because we don't do that. we are bings! and if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
6264, wow! i had no idea you had this much pride., that's right! i do! and i'm your man. and i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
6265," well you know it's just like living with a girl. only they don't steal your makeup. unless they're playing ""this is what my sister would look like"" (looks at chandler)", yeah.... she's not so cute.
6266, we don't do that! tell her we don't do that!, yes dear.
6267, this is easy...can't do this! (moves away...and finds her sweater sleeve stuck to the drawer) oh! wow! seriously i can't do this. (fiddles more), listen er..i need to ask you a favor but you can't tell monica anything about it.
6268, i thought you didn't have secrets from monica., and that would have made the official party line. (joey nods) monica and i are having a little financial trouble.  what? what do you mean you know?
6269," err... i just figured it out! you know, i mean you're not working and the economy is bad.", oh! right.
6270, (to himself) that's the fastest i have ever thought!," anyway, err... i need to borrow some money."
6271, oh! sure! how much? two thousand dollars?, yes! two thousand dollars exactly! how do you know that! (joey begins writing a cheque)
6272, err...well i...know how much you used to make and i know how much your rent is. (shrugs), oh ok.
6273, err... kind of., i can't believe her! did she tell you we were having money problems?
6274," oh no no no no no... it wasn't... it wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.  something personal.", what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
6275, thanks....., hey rach! there she is...my perfectly proportioned wife.
6276, thank you?, oh no..don't thank me. thank you. you know there's not one thing i would change about you? not one single thing! and definitely not... two... single things.
6277," ok, you're being wierd. do you want sex or did you do something bad?"," no no! i just love the way you look, i am warm, for your form."
6278," ok..you know the old classics you know,you look nice? they're still ok."," well yes yes... you look nice can mean that your face looks nice. i want to compliment your body. i mean..i wouldn't change it. at all. and more specifically, i wouldn't want anything to get any bigger."
6279, okay...," i mean, you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? don't answer that."
6280," rach?! (he walks over to the fridge to put it in, but it cannot be opened either) rachel!!!!? (he walks to the bathroom and tries to lift the toilet seat cover. it won't come up.) so i can't do anything i like????", hey rach! ah........ perfection. (kisses monica) wouldn't change a thing. not a thing.
6281, honey?  about that? erm...i'm going to change., but honey you don't have to.
6282, i'm going to get bigger!, honey i... i love your breasts the way they are!
6283," well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! and you know what? it's not just my breasts. my ass is going to get bigger too.", your ass?!?!?
6284," man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!", they...do that?
6285, it's kind of a package deal!, god why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
6286, i thought i was something that we both wanted!," alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. but the giant ass and the big clown feet?"
6287," oh my god chandler! if you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? with the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?", (sedated) what?
6288," hey hey, can i help?"," well! we er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky."
6289, someday., aaaaand....... hernia.
6290, we're all sorry... (they have a group hug)," ah, look on the bright side, i mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! that was here already huh? i love you. (they hug again)"
6291," ah hah! i did it! ha ha! alright... (he takes a box out, about to close fridge, then thinks.) better take all i can carry. who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!", hey! ready to go?
6292," hey ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, i can't do that!", what are you doin'?
6293," have you seen this? it's a new alumni website for college! it's cool! you can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to."," great, a faster way to tell people that i'm unemployed and childless ."
6294, it's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember andrea rich?, the tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
6295," uh uh... well, her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...", bet she'd sleep with you now...
6296, no... i already e-mailed her.," let me see what you wrote about yourself: ""doctor paleontology, two kids... "" (pause) you split with carol because you have different interests?... i think you split with carol because you've one very similar interest!"
6297, (he picks up the ball) what do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)," maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on ross' computer) ""also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab. she's now my girlfriend. i don't care what society says. it's the best sex i've ever had""... aaand send!"
6298," breaking up sucks! oh, i really miss mike!"," oh, i'm so sorry!"
6299," oh god, i tried everything to make myself feel better. i even tried writing a song about it... but... i can't think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh!! (pause) hey monica, i really need your help getting through this...", you're not gonna need my help?
6300," well no, when i get to the point where... you know... i'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike... i'm gonna come to you.","oh good, 'cause i've already thought of 3... 4! i've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)"
6301, (yelling at chandler) i have sex with dinosaurs??, i believe i read that somewhere!
6302," that only is not funny, it's physically impossible! ok? depending on the species i'd have to have a six foot long... (pause) it's not funny!!", i respectfully disagree.
6303, i can't believe you put that on my alumni page!, who cares? nobody reads those things
6304, you'd better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today., i don't have a page.
6305," alright, wait a second, why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... (reads from the screen) ""gay as the day is long""?", because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
6306, but that's clearly a joke. this could easily be true. (phone rings), would you get that please? people have been calling to congratulate me all day.
6307," (on the phone) hello? no, he's not here. yeah, this is his wife. yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. i guess i should have known. yeah, i mean, he just kept making me watch moulin rouge."," hang up, hang up. and that was a great movie! (monica hangs up) i'm so gonna get back at ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).  oh, you'll see my friend."
6308, (visibly upset) i'm dead?, (faking sympathy) and so young.
6309, posting that i died? that really isn't funny.," well, how you died was funny."
6310," oh please, hit by a blimp?", it kills over one americans every year.
6311," unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think i'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. you're messing with people's feelings here.", you wanna talk about people's feelings? you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn't be able to go with him to key west!
6312," you know, on the way over here, i saw this drunk guy throw up. and then a pigeon ate it!"," hey, ross, i just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?"
6313," uhu uhu, check this out. (chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)", huh! so that's what i would look like if i worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. you're not actually going to send these out are ya?
6314," eh..actually no, i don't need to because your little ""ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that i'm dead. (silence) oh my god! nobody cares that i'm dead!?"," no, come on, you know that's not true."
6315, what are you talking about? you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! i didn't get one response! and i'm dead!," well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community."
6316, i can't believe this. not even my geology lab partner? and i carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)," alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? that people are gonna post condolences on a website? this is not about people not caring that you're dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."
6317, you're right. there isn't a decent outlet.," right, i mean, come on, i'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."
6318, exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)," ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)you're having a memorial service for yourself!?"
6319, no! that would be stupid! you're having it for me!," ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
6320," it's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! i tell you, when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!", there you go! someone came!
6321," hi, glad you could come."," (in a mournful voice) please, come in."
6322," hi, you're chandler bing, right? i'm tom gordon, i was in your class."," oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat."
6323," thanks... uh... i'm so sorry about ross, it's...", at least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
6324, who is he?," some guy, tom gordon."
6325, what? you... you... oh! can i ask you a personal question? ho-how do you shave your beard so close?," (entering, very upset) ok tommy, that's enough mourning for you! here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)"
6326," (before leaving) hey, listen. call me.", ok! (shuts the door behind tom)
6327, i look like a man??," please, one ridiculous problem at a time!"
6328," it isn't ridiculous, look around! no one's here!"," you gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
6329,"yes, you're right. still somebody must have seen it... i mean, i went to that school for 4 years, i didn't have an impact on anyone?","oh, that's not true. you had an impact on me, i mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. doesn't that count for something?"
6330, (sceptical) yeah...," i'm sure it's somebody for you. now, go hide. (ross hides in the bedroom again)"
6331, hi. i'm here for ross geller's memorial service., kori? kori weston?
6332, and you are...," chandler, chandler bing. i'm not gay, i'm not gay at all."
6333, you are married though.," don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)"
6334, i can't believe that ross is gone. it is just so sad., i didn't know ross and you were so close.
6335, we weren't but we had one class together. he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. i always remembered him.," i'm sure that would mean a lot to him. and if heaven has a door, i'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
6336,"yeah with chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.","yeah, because if i was at my old job we'd say 300 million? no thank you!"
6337," (in a mocking voice)uh...sure i do, and i also wanna be king of my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart.", still on amelia earhart?
6338,no! do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? i...i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.,yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
6339,"seriously you guys, i can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, i mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.", (looking around at the others)i'll ask. (to ross) boohaki?
6340, well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what i'm saying., kinda like joey.
6341, god! look at all these tickets! it's so exciting! you know i haven't won anything since the sixth grade., pie eating contest?
6342, oh! you assume because i was heavy that's the only way i could win something?," no, i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries."
6343," yeah, uh... and then i figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!"," (hysterical)don't touch the phone! i'll get it, i'll get it, i'll get it!! (picks up the phone)"
6344, (to monica)think he washed his hands?," (into receiver)hello? hey charlie, what do you know?"
6345, (smiling)look who's coming around!, (still on the phone)damnit. alright call me when you know more.
6346, (excited)did you get it?, one of the slots got filled.
6347, (still excited)by you!?, sense the tone! no that kid nate got it.
6348, oh! i hate that guy! i mean come on kid! pull up your pants!, yeah i know.
6349," well, there's two spots left right?"," yeah...i mean i want this so much! i mean, i wanna get one, i want my friend charlie to get one...except i don't care about charlie."
6350," ok, i've heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that."," i can see the headline now: ""lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm""."
6351, why would i eat my own arm?," well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want."
6352, get a room!," ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?"
6353," i don't know, probably just invest it.", ooh! calm down ...
6354, (touched) you would do that? i never get picked!," you know, i'm not sure a sports team is the way to go."
6355, you're not gonna let me buy the knicks?? i can't believe you're taking this away from me!,"you're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds."
6356," (to rachel) uh, how long until they announce the numbers, mommy?", (looks around) i'll take this one too (to ross) uh ... mommy?
6357, (tries to be sexy too) well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no i can't.," hello? hello? oh, hey charlie. did anybody else hear? ... what? susan got it?? how? oh man, i would have slept with him!! .. alright, bye. (hangs up)"
6358," dude, i'm sorry. but hey, there's one spot left, right?"," well no, charlie's gonna get that."
6359," hey, don't say that! you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!", he's the boss's son.
6360," ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?", what about the ones you have on the nightstand?
6361, there are no tickets on the nightstand!," yes there are, i just saw them a few minutes ago."
6362," un, no you didn't! you must be mistaken!","honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!"
6363," chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?"," (to mon) she's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ..."
6364, ahhh! (shocked)," let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it doesn't look like i'm gonna get this job so i can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from rachel)"
6365," hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! this all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from monica)"," oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery!"
6366, don't come any closer!," can i come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished..."
6367," as a matter of fact she said that's how i am going to die. (pause ) so, excuse me for being a little skittish."," (looking at the answering machine) hey, there's two messages. these could be from work!"
6368," oh, play them!"," ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)"
6369," ""hey chandler, it's charlie""", this is..shhh!
6370," oh, it is so unfair. it's like that time they promoted sandra over me at work."," oh, is she related to ralph lauren?"
6371," (she hugs chandler) honey, you've been really strong about this, i know how badly you wanted that job.","yeah, you know, i really thought i deserved it. (pause) but... let's go win the lottery... i mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?"
6372,"""here we are, the official powerball numbers! we have 53""", i got that!
6373," just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) no!  (answering phone) hello? hold on. it's your boss."," ah, the ""i'm sorry i rejected you"" phone call. i'm not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the sofa) hey, steve."
6374," chandler, hi! i'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. we just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant."," oh no no no no, i'd love to be somebody's assistant! answering phones, getting coffee, i live for that stuff! and i'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!"
6375," chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. we're offering you the position of junior copywriter."," me, that guy who just said butt cracks?"
6376," yes, that's right. we're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job."," ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. i'll see you tomorrow (hangs up).  what? (pause) oh, yeah, i'm gonna be a junior copywriter."
6377," oh sweetie, i'm so proud of you!", does that mean i get the good loving tonight?
6378," (to chandler) hey, that is so great about the job."," thanks, man."
6379, and i like to think i had a little something to do with it., really? what?
6380," well, before, with the wishbone... i didn't wish we would win the lottery, i wished you'd get the job."," (smiling, surprised) oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, worried) listen, don't tell monica, she'll rip your heart right out."
6381,"i know that, but look, we've got the powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!","wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout."
6382," well, it was an accident...you know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!", (to monica) have i got a surprise for you? pack your bags!
6383,oh no!you guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!," what? no, i'm taking monica to a romantic inn in vermont (shows them a brochure)!"
6384," oh, good!ok, good for you!try to recapture the magic!"," so, what do you say? can you get out of work?"
6385," oh, honey!i can't. i was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!", are you really that busy?
6386," yeah, i'm sorry. i really am."," oh, that's ok.i'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) ""hi, this is chandler bing. i made a reservation there and i need to change it (pause) oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? can i just come some other time? (pause) oh, can't you make an exception?"""
6387,and tell them that in 2 weeks i will once again be a masseuse in good standing!," (on the phone) ""look, this is ridiculous! i'm not paying for that room! ok?"" (pause) ""oh, thank you very much!"" (hangs up) yeah, i'm going to vermont..."
6388," oh, don't worry about it! just use your travel insurance.", i don't have travel insurance.
6389," (pause) ok, say no more.  (with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): it wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! everyone! it wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to monica, showing her dress) classy, uh?"," hi, chandler bing, i have a reservation."
6390," welcome to the chestnut inn mr. bing, so where are you joining from?", new york.
6391, (in a strange voice and eating candies) the big apple!," i'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here."
6392," i am sorry mr. bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer."," well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?"
6393, not there.," let me get this straight. i called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and i was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?"
6394, (mumbling) she doesn't know what to say!, just give us the cheapest room you have.
6395," unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.", that's insane!
6396," totally insane. dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.", does that room have a closet i can lock him in? (pause) we'll take it.
6397, great.," (aside, to ross) what!? they are totally ripping us off!"
6398," dude, don't worry 'bout it! i know how we can make your money back! this is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! like those apples. instead of taking one, i'm... i take six!"," great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!"
6399," c'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!"," dude, you're shaking!"
6400,"(on the phone) hi, this is ross geller in suite 206. it seems you forgot a couple of things. could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) thank you! ok. toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and i feel like i am forgetting something... is there anything else you have that i haven't asked for already? (pause) yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.", usa today
6401," nice, put it with the others.", and i also got... two more apples.
6402," we are four short of a bush-o (pause). god i feel so alive, i love being in the country!", i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
6403," no, chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. for example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) i wish i'd thought this through."," i think i know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that."
6404," not my first time in a hotel, my friend."," ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?"
6405," no, no, no, you can't take the remote control!"," yes, but the batteries...  thank you, thank you very much!"
6406," here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay."," oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.  oh, i didn't factor in the room tax."
6407," oh dude, don't worry about it, i found an unattended maid's car. we're way ahead of the game.  there's something new in the bowl."," look, we have enough, just walk away."
6408," no, but i want...i want the pinecones!", there's a forest right outside.
6409, it's not the same.," ok, go quick!"
6410," well.. hey, you know what else i could use? there's a scene where drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! and he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (in a romantic voice) and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when i would think to myself, my god, she...is... beautiful... (rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz i knew i could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.  (excited) thanks dude!!!this is great!! (leaves rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)", i got you something from vermont! (sits down at the table)
6411," (enters the room) hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?"," (browsing through a diary) well, let me see... i-i believe i'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the tv."
6412," look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.", i could fall asleep at a play.
6413," i wish i could but i just found out that i have to be at work really early the next day, so i can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want."," (browsing through a diary) uh, let's see, who do i hate?"
6414," hey, you guys won't believe what i have to do for work today."," yes, but, ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs."
6415, (to chandler) is he gonna introduce us?," (to monica) no, i think we're just blurry shapes to him now."
6416, (shocked) oh my god! chandler!, where the hell is everybody?
6417," well, i bet you are all thinkin' ""now would be a really great time for an intermission"", huh?"," (to himself) oh yes, god yes!!"
6418,"(now yelling) well, you're not gonna get one! because in life there are no intermissions, people. chapter 7: divorce is a 4 letter word. (now standing right in front of chandler and bending down almost to his level as if speaking to him, yelling even louder) how could he leave me?!?!", i... i don't know... you seem lovely.
6419," oh! screw it, i didn't get it! (they high-five)  oh, very funny... joey."," (to monica) so, how did you enjoy the play?"
6420," oh my god, honey, i'm so so so so so sorry.", well you should be. you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
6421, you really liked it?,"oh yeah! i mean at first i hated it, but why wouldn't i, because as a man i've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) but after chapter 16: ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", i was uplifted."
6422, oh really!," oh yeah, i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! tell me, tell me about your first period!  did somebody sign your bra?"
6423," hey, thank you so much for these tickets, chandler."," oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and i wanted to share it with you."
6424, why don't you like me! chapter one: my first period.," can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away)."
6425," hey, i thought i'd end up kissing charlie too ok? but surprise!"," i missed most of the party (pause) charlie's a girl, right?"
6426, ok. (they both go)," (to joey) so, a professor, uh?"
6427, (entering) hey honey! i missed you today!," oh, yeah?"
6428, yeah. (they kiss) what d'you wanna do tonight?," oh, well... maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites monica to have sex on it)"
6429," ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? know your audience! besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.", we really need to take those tests?
6430," honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. i think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. just a few routine tests.", but i don't wanna do it in a cup!
6431, what is the big deal?, it's weird! in a doctor's office?
6432, it's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell?," (embarrassed) i cannot believe ross told you that! (pause) and in my defense, it was a wendy's!"
6433," look, i don't wanna do this test either, but i really do think it's a good idea!"," yeah, ok. i'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the hershey's factory!"
6434, (really embarrassed) oh!," oh, yeah! rachel talks too!"
6435," whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! so, i walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left. ross then bends joey's arm to the right and joey nods)", i have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) how do i know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
6436, mr. bing? (chandler jumps up) here you are! you'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.,"deposit my specimen? you know, usually i have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. thanks, got it."
6437," hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?"," yeah, i guess!"
6438," i know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! no one here even knows you!"," oh, come on!"
6439," hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!", why are you here?
6440," well, sid and i are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we..."," (to heaven) no no no... i mean, why? why is she here??"
6441, oh! someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) oh! they gave you the kiddy size (looking at the cup in his hand)., what!?
6442, this was fun! but i've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! (leaves)," i'd love to stay, but i have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)"
6443, please... go! (then shouts after him) just let me know if you need a hand!, (disgusted) i think it just fell off. (leaves)
6444, no! (slaps his hand), (to the nurse at the nurses' station) my specimen is in the room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there. really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees janice is still there) janice! you're not... gone?
6445, oh! sid is still in his room. i don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. so did you do it? did you make your deposit?, yeah! yeah... the hard part is over!
6446," that's not the hard part honey! the hard part is what comes next, i mean aren't you worried about the results?", i haven't... i haven't even thought about the results yet... i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
6447," oh! well, you know what? it probably is."," (slightly panicky) yeah, but what if it's not? what if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?"
6448," oh, chandler, look. you and monica are meant to have children. i am sure it's gonna be just fine."," (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can't believe i didn't even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'..."
6449," what, you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?"," (stares at her intently, then yells) it was a ""wendy's!! """
6450," although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... (confidently) i made it work."," (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) it is not okay that i'm aroused by this now.  hello? oh hi, doctor connelly. (pause) no, she's not here but, you know, i can tell her. should i be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) oh. (pause) well, so what does that mean? (pause) ok. ok, thank you. thanks. (hangs up)"
6451, hey sweetie., doctor connelly just called.
6452," with good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) of course it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) ""doctor connelly just called"". if it was good news you would have said (excitedly) ""doctor connelly just called! "" but so what is it? is there a problem, uh? is there a problem with me or with you?", actually it's both of us.  apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
6453, oh... what does that mean?," it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) it means...  (seriously) it means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us."
6454, (weeping) oh my god!, i'm sorry.
6455, i'm sorry too.," well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
6456," why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?", (looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) wow! fortunately she has a very pretty face!
6457," oh, i so can't believe this! my uterus is an inhospitable environment? i was trying so hard to be a good hostess!"," oh, i can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!"
6458," (entering) hi there.  i'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but i wanted to talk to you about your options.  above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! so, keep having sex on a regular basis."," oh, damn it!"
6459," and, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt."," is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (dr. connelly glares at him) wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!"
6460," tsz... no! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).", (entering) hey guys!
6461," wait a minute, you guys. oh, i wanna ask you something. i-i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do, i'd love for you guys to come and hear me."," i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick."
6462, it's in barbados., but you come first!
6463," bye, see ya. (she goes)", (sitting down on the couch) ok.
6464," all right, so. how did it go at the fertility clinic?", not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
6465, so-so what did the doctor say?," well... there's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
6466," so you're ruling out surrogacy?  so, i don't have to learn what that means?"," aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."
6467," enough said, i'm there for you man. where is she, upstairs?", (stopping joey) ah-ha!
6468, how do you feel about all this?, i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don't think there is one.
6469, hi honey!," hey! look i brought a friend for dinner, this is zack, from work!"
6470, (shaking monica's hand) you too.," you guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! you're both polite! (pause) go to have a seat zack, and i'll get you a beer."
6471, thanks.," (to mon) so, zack's pretty nice, uh?"
6472," yeah, i guess."," so, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
6473, (turns around and she's quite shocked) excuse me?," well, we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, i mean, he is ""spermtastic""!"
6474," chandler, this is crazy! what did you even say to him! ""come up, meet my wife! give us your sperm""!"," no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.  i'm telling you, he's great! i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, i'd think he'd be the way to go!"
6475, i'm not going to be a part of this! you can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!, ok!
6476, uh!, (bringing the beer to zack) zack!
6477, oh! i'm gonna go wash up first. (chandler points him the bathroom) thanks!," so what do you think? i want that guys genes for my kid! those eyes, those cheeckbones!"
6478," ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!", you don't like him.
6479, i think he is fine! it's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information., alright! just follow my lead!
6480, you guys have such a great place here.," oh! thanks, i'm crazy about our place. hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?"
6481, uhm... no. although i did have an uncle who voted for dukakis., (very seriously) that's really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack.
6482, ok. i heard a joke today. it's pretty funny...," you know what's not funny? male pattern baldness (monica stretches her neck to look behind zack's head and then gives chandler an ""ok"" sign)"
6483, ravioli's delicious!, i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. did you have braces as a child?
6484, yess!! (m & c high-five and zack looks confused again), (proceeding with his dinner) we're teeth people zack!
6485," i'm gonna take off now. you're gonna let me go home, aren't you?", you sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
6486," no, no, i should get home, i'm kinda tired."," are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."
6487, no it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. i'll see you tomorrow., i think we've found our sperm!
6488, does seem pretty perfect.," yeah, you think so, well? should i ask him?"
6489, (pause) no.," why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!"
6490," no, that's not it. it's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, i just... i just realized i don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you."," yeah, he's better!"
6491," no, he's not. and if i can't get pregnant with you, then i don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.", really? are you sure?
6492," yeah, i'm sure."," (sighs with relief) thank god, because i don't wanna do this either. you know, i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do. you know, i'm the husband, i'm supposed to... bring the sperm."
6493, that is so sweet. i love you. (they kiss), so you know this leaves us with...
6494, adoption., how do you feel about that?
6495, i think i feel ok about it. actually i think i feel really good about it., me too. i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you. and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
6496," so this is it, we're really gonna adopt?", (smiling) yeah.
6497," (excitedly) oh my god, we're gonna be parents!", we are gonna be great parents.
6498," and it could be soon. i mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived."," wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!  hey, zack!"
6499, (hardly enthusiastic) hey chandler.," look, i just wanted to apologize for last night. i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable."
6500, no you didn't.  no you did.," my wife and i have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. we're working on it."
6501," oh, thank you."," you wouldn't know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"
6502, do you have anything that would... get us out of them?," yeah ross, i mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff""."
6503, (to chandler) see?," yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
6504," really, it doesn't mean anything. i mean, you know, monica refers to chandler as richard all the time!", (upset) she does?
6505," (to chandler) well, phoebe's still pretty hung up on that mike, uh?", i wouldn't read too much into it.
6506," still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?"," david, let me stop you there 'cause i think i see where this is going. i'm not very good at giving advice. so if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."
6507," sorry, i just... i wish there was something i could do, you know? well, you know phoebe..."," seriously, we're gonna do this?"
6508," i'm sorry, uh... i just wish i could make her forget about mike already, you know... why did phoebe and mike break up?"," oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that david is not amused) oh, i'm sorry, that's the kind of thing i do. (pause) they broke up because mike didn't want to get married. hey, what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?"
6509," that's great! that's great! i-i'll propose to her!  well, i was probably going to do it at some point.", i didn't mean now...
6510," why not? it's brilliant! (talking to an imaginary mike) goodbye mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! (pause) well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... (to chandler) thank you, chandler. sincerely."," well, you're welcome! glad i could help."
6511, (after a while) how do you think i should propose?," david, i'm pretending to read here!!"
6512, wow! that mike thing was interesting! i don't know what's gonna happen with phoebe and david.," (smiling cheekily) i do! want a hint? huh? ""i do"" (monica looks confused, so chandler repeats) ""i do""."
6513," ok, i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.", david is going to propose to phoebe.
6514, what? (looks very shocked) why?," be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married."
6515," chandler, we have talked about this. you are not supposed to give people advice! now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?"," i did! a penis one! look, just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said?"
6516," they've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike! she'll say ""no"", david's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again."," man, that's some bad advice!"
6517," ok! when i go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!", that's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross!
6518," so, ehm... i'm proposing to pheobe tonight. (removes a ring box from his pocket and opens it to show chandler the ring)"," tonight?! (looks at the ring) isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) oh, there it is!"
6519," yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. that's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. and the clarity is uhm... is quite poor."," (slaps him on the shoulder) nice! (goes to monica)  monica, can i talk to you for a sec? (pulls her away from phoebe and rachel)"
6520, ok!, david is going to propose to phoebe tonight!
6521, see what happens when you give people advice? i hope you told him not to?, that would be advice!!
6522, ross just read me his speech. it's fantastic!," oh, is it on the computer, cuz i'd love to give it a read...?"
6523," if you want to check your email, just ask! (chandler tries to look offended)", (offended) what? (pause) may i?
6524, it's not the time charlie.," (at the laptop) oh, no, no, no dear god, no!"
6525," oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (chandler looks annoyed at him and joey leans in to him) oh! secret teapot?"," your computer, i don't know wha... everything's gone!"
6526, wha... what do you mean? (goes to the laptop), it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive.
6527," what, oh my god. what did you do?", someone i don't know sent me an e-mail and i opened it.
6528," why, why would you open it?"," well, it didn't say ""this is a virus""!!"
6529, what did it say?, nude... (ross looks at him)... pictures of anna kournikova. i'm so sorry.
6530," what... what am i gonna do? my speech is gone, chandler!"," it's not gone! i mean, i'm sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy, right?"
6531, no! i don't!!," well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!"
6532, yep! i'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!, i just feel awful.
6533," yeah, well you should! i mean, nude pictures of anna kournikova? i mean, she's never even won a major tournament!"," well, i tried billy jean king, but... (ross glares at him) you know, you and monica have the same ""i'm gonna kill you"" look...? i can usually make it go away by kissing her... (ross continues to glare at him and chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss ross)"
6534," you don't tell me what to do! i tell you what to do! just call her. she's at the paradise hotel in barbados. and while i've got you, you've got curly hair. what do you do in humidity? (mike hangs up the phone) damnit!  (sarcastically) well, i hope you're happy!"," (pretending not to sense the tone) oooh! i hope you're happy too, honey!"
6535," phoebe is going to say ""yes"" to david. see, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!"," phoebe is going to say ""yes""? that's, that's great!"
6536," no it's not, b'cause she's still in love with mike!", and there's not chance that will work?
6537," no, i called him. it's not gonna happen.", (pointing at her) oooooooh! meddler! meddler!
6538," well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, i wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!", this vacation sucks!!
6539, i can't believe she's gonna say yes to david. she's clearly in love with mike.," you know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that."
6540," oh my god, he's gonna do it now. please, i cannot watch this, let's go."," i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk? (doing david) ""uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh..."" spit it out, david!"
6541, i have a ring.," i wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."
6542, (to everybody) because of our meddling! alright?," oh, ain't this nice? it's so quiet, i could just lie here all day."
6543, (walking in hurriedly) open your drapes! open your drapes!, i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
6544, the sun is out!, hey! remember when i had corneas?
6545," ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and i'll get the magazines and the lotion.",ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
6546," finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: gigantosaurus, argentinasaurus...", (to a paleontologist sitting next to him) not to mention the cold sores.
6547," and that's just the herbivores. i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.", (to the one sitting next to him) really?
6548," (pleasantly surprised) ping pong? (to chandler) honey, they have ping pong! let's play!", i don't think so!
6549, (disappointed) why not?," because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it's cute, others disagree, and i'm lying!"
6550, i'm not always that bad!," oh, yeah? what happened when we played last time?"
6551, (hesitatingly) i punched you...?, and...?
6552," so, we're just four losers... super!", i'm not playing with you.
6553," mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!", she gets crazy! this scar (points to his forehead) is from pictionary!
6554," oh, by the way... i'm awesome!!"," (nearly whispering) oh dear god, there's two of them!"
6555," hell, yeah!", (to phoebe) did you know this about him?
6556, (nearly shouting) one thousand..., (interrupting her) ok!
6557, (going through her pockets) no... (to chandler and phoebe) either of you girls got a quarter?," honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!"
6558, ah yeaaaah!, (to phoebe) do you really find this attractive on him?
6559," (looking at mike) oh, yeah! (turning to chandler) are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by monica, right now?", i think this is the first time in our marriage that i've felt like the more attractive one.
6560, and that's how it's done! (phoebe kisses him)," okay-dokay, you've each won a game and i've lost what's felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner."
6561, that's what i'm thinking., should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
6562,"ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41."," (exhausted) ok, look! enough is enough!"
6563," no, i have just to have two more points to beat him!"," monica, that was also true an hour ago! i mean, please, look at you! your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!"
6564, i can't just walk away! i've put in four hours!, but...
6565," look! you knew this about me when you married me! you agreed to take me in sickness and in health. well, this is my sickness!", what about the obsessive cleaning?
6566," that's just good sense!  (in pain) aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)", you ok?
6567, i can't believe it! (pause) i lost!," no, you didn't.  because i'm gonna play for ya."
6568," (to chandler) honey, you don't have to do this."," (in a loving voice) yes, i do. now, i may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because i love you."
6569, but... you suck!," (still in a loving voice) you're welcome, sweetheart.  all right mike, let's get this over with. sudden death. whoever wins this point, wins."
6570, it's like watching porn!, and that's... how... it's done!
6571, (to chandler) oh my god. that was so amazing! when did you (pause) hold on! i almost forgot (she turns to mike) loser! (back to chandler) when did you stop sucking?," i never sucked, i actually didn't want you to know how good i was!"
6572, this is so great! now we can enter into doubles tournaments!, that's why!
6573," oh, the way you crushed mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.you wanna...? (plays with her finger on chandlers chest)"," you know, i'd love to, but i'm a little tired."
6574, i'll put a pillowcase over my head., you're on!
6575, sounds like he's with someone.," he could be alone. this morning i heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps."
6576," oh my god, that's charlie!", she's cheating on joey with ross!
6577, ooh..., wow!
6578, i can't believe this. rachel and joey?, how about the dinosaur twins in the other room? no-one is manning that wall!
6579, i'm on it!, anything?
6580," bedsprings, unmistakable!", you do realise that's your brother?
6581," not until you said it. somebody switch! (chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and phoebe runs to the other wall. monica returns to chandlers wall.) wait a minute... ross and charlie, joey and rachel, phoebe and mike! we're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.", that's not true. i came with monica and i'm leaving with weird al.
6582," okay, i've had it with the hair jokes. tomorrow morning, before we leave, i'm going to the salon.", okay buckwheat!
6583, that's the door. he's gone..., and she's... turning on the tv... and watching... miss congeniality!
6584," (also hugs the wall) yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to phoebe)", (caresses the wall with his finger) bye!
6585," okay, uhm... hey, you guys seen joey anywhere?", he's probably in his room with his current girlfriend charlie. that's the situation as we know it... (walks to phoebe and monica)
6586," well, if you see him could you please tell him i'm looking for him?", you got it!
6587," all right, look you guys... look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it..."," okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? the people that care about you?"
6588, sure..., enunciate!
6589, you guys ready to go?," not quite. monica's still at the salon, and i'm just finishing packing."
6590, dude! you're not taking your bible?," you're not supposed to take that. besides, it's a new testament, what are you gonna do with it?"
6591, who's day just got better? chandler!, hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
6592, what do you think?, i think.... i think i can see your scalp.
6593, and listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells tingle), what d'ya know... it's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
6594," whoo, whoo. wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that i'm sitting next to charlie after we broke up."," yeah, it's almost if air barbados doesn't care about your social life."
6595," no, i'll do it. (he quickly grabs joey's boarding pass and gives joey his one.)", wish i could switch with someone. i really don't wanna sit with allen iverson over there.
6596," oh, i can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) ow!"," you go back to work tomorrow night, right?"
6597, yeah!," so if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?"
6598," well, if i had them taken out, then i wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against chandler's chest) you like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)", what are you singing?
6599,"it's ""bolero"" from ""10""."," it's ""ride of the valkyries"" from ""apocalypse now""... see, here's the thing: the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. and now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... i hate them!"
6600, you what? you said you liked them., did i? let's refresh. i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp.
6601," fine, so you don't like them. everybody else does."," again, let's journey back... as i recall what rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. and joey... well, joey didn't realise that there was anything different."
6602," you know what? i don't care. i like it like this, and i'm gonna keep it. you're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) ouch!", hit yourself in the tooth?
6603, you're welcome!," honey, you've been in there for a long time... is everything okay?"
6604, not really.  i have a problem., really? what happened?
6605," well, i was dancing around, and singing ""no woman, no cry"" and i got stuck.", you can't move at all?
6606," oh, well, i can move... (she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)"," if i untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?"
6607, (looking disappointed) i guess so..., (trying to untangle her) some of these look a little frayed.
6608, look what i found in the drawer... (chandler looks up from his book.) and you said i'd never wear this...," now that i untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?"
6609," sure, what do you have in mind?", i think you know.
6610, really? i don't really feel like it., this is what i want to do.
6611," okay, i just don't get why you like it so much."," (picks up the ""miss congeniality"" dvd) she's an fbi agent, posing as a beauty contestant."
6612," god, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. there's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. there are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.", there's a hair in my coffee.
6613," hey guys!  hey, have you seen frank jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.","you know, it's funny. every time you say ""triplets,"" i immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds."
6614, we went through the same thing when we were adopting.," so, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?  i mean, you have a lovely home."
6615," i know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us."," that's great. (to monica.) can i see the book?  you want me to wash my hands first, don't you?"
6616, can i adopt you?," hey, you must be owen."
6617, you were?," yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother."
6618, huh?, you know how to use a compass?
6619, i have a badge in it., you do? that's fantastic!
6620, you wanna see it?," i'd love to, but i gotta get back to talking to your parents. they're telling us all about how they adopted you."
6621, what?!?  i'm adopted?, i got nothing.
6622," look at them! aw. i love you so much. (strokes leslie's hair, and she moves a little.) oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!", where are bill and colleen?
6623, they're in the kitchen getting something to eat. can you believe how nice they are?, we have to leave!!
6624, why? what did you do in the bathroom?," i didn't get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. and there's a slight chance i may have told him."
6625," i'll go get him in a second. by the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.", but kids are so intuitive. don't you think on some level he already knows?
6626, i'm adopted?!, see? intuitive!
6627,he told me! and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell., which technically now you should give back!
6628, you told him he's adopted?," i'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that santa is real."""
6629," hey, phoebs  uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. bill and colleen hate us."," owen didn't know he was adopted, and monica told him."
6630," still, he had to find out sometime."," yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?  i'm gonna go tell emma she was an accident. (runs off.)  so, you and rachel tonight, huh?"
6631, yeah. it's actually our first official date, wow! so tonight may be the night! you're nervous?
6632," naa, no. this is the part i'm actually good at.", what must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
6633, (pause) it's ok!, how can you be so confident?
6634," well, i... i know exactly what i'm gonna do!", really? like you have a routine?
6635," no, no no no no. see. each woman is different.you have to appreciate their uniqueness.  no, i do six things! first, i look deep in her eyes. then, i kiss her. next i take my hand and i softly graze her thigh.", you mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)
6636," no! not like that, no no. no, like this. (he starts lightly grazing chandler's thigh)"," oh, i see what you mean, that's quite nice. (they look at each other, both embarassed)"
6637, more foosball?, ...and beer!!
6638, (looking at monica's legs) wow!, hey! stop staring at my wife's legs! no no! stop staring at your sister's legs!
6639," i'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?", she went on one of those spray-on tan places.
6640," (laughing) why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?", (to monica) why...why?
6641," still, i can't believe that's sprayed on... i mean, it looks really good. i wonder if i should get one!"," sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off."
6642," i know, amanda! ah! she called me too! she's the worst!", who's amanda?
6643," she's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. then she moved to england and she picked up this fake british accent. on the machine this is her message. (she apes amanda using an awful british accent) ""monica, darling! it's amanda calling!""", are you trying to do a british accent?
6644, (pause) (to phoebe) chandler gets pedicures!," just so i know, how many more of those can i expect?"
6645," oh, i guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! (to chandler) have you ever done that?"," no, had it done to me though. feels good !"
6646," ok, don’t hold thy breath!", hello? is someone on the line?
6647," yes, i was looking for monica."," hang on, she’s right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to monica) someone's on the phone, for ya."
6648," we weren’t picking up, it’s amanda!", (to amanda) i get pedicures!
6649, (contemplates for a few moments what rachel just said) nah! i don't have another level!!, hold on! there is something different.
6650, i went to that tanning place your wife suggested., was that place... the sun?
6651," oh! and it gets worse! (turns his side to chandler and monica and pulls up his shirt. there's a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)", oh my god! you can do a duet of ebony and ivory all by yourself!
6652, oh oh! what is up with miss hawaiian tropic?, how was your date with joey?
6653," well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and i kept slapping it away!", you didn't like that?
6654," (sees what he is doing) chandler, stop! it is not going to pop open!", (without taking his eyes off the bra) you don't know! (monica just smiles)
6655, we are not friends with phoebe anymore.," if she asks, i protested a little, but ok!"
6656," ooh, that accident must have been terrible. you look positively ghastly."," well, aren't you a treat."
6657," no, i mean with us, you know. i mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?"," that fake british woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... hey!"
6658," hi! hey, listen, can we ask you a question? when you and monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?"," kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys..."
6659," yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?"," actually, no. no, it felt right. you know, it felt like uhm... i can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.  i can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... well, i'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(chandler leaves the apartment. joey sighs)"
6660," yeah, me too.  ooh, yeah, i'm not going anywhere for a while."," dude, it's chandler. let me in."
6661, go away! i don't want to see anybody.," i know, i went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. you have to let me in."
6662," really? did you count mississipily?  dude, you're not tanned."," no, i just had to get a picture of this.  i see you later!"
6663," no, that day... that won't be her real birthday!", gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
6664," well, i'm sorry, but chandler and i could really use a weekend away. you know, to reconnect... emotionally.", there's this thing i really want us to do. i read about it in maxim...
6665," all right, we'll stay. we can just drive up after the party."," fine, but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party..."
6666," yeah, but for a one-year-old. what's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer. and he's standing next to this cow and the cow says ""el-moo""! (joey starts laughing) yeah... that's a funny cup!", hey hey! where's the birthday girl?
6667," oh, she's still napping"," oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening."
6668, i can't believe emma is still asleep!," i know, what are we gonna do?"
6669, i've got a plan. i've got a plan. i'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. you're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!, i'm not going to vermont with this monica!
6670," (speaking to the person on the phone again) yes, yes. i still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!", to be fair this one does have nuts.
6671,"well, you know what? while we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at monica and chandler) ok!",hi emma! it's the year 2020. are you still enjoying your nap?
6672," we're aunt monica and uncle chandler, by the way. you may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!"," we used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. because of you! happy birthday. (ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)"
6673," (into receiver) hello? (listens) oh no! what happened? (listens some more) ok ok, where are you? (grabs a pen and starts writing). ok, i'll be right there. (puts the phone down)", was that emma? is she up?
6674," no, wait ! you guys, no, no, you can't leave! rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. how do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?", i don't know! you'll tell us on monday!
6675, got it! (goes towards the front door and stands with his back to it) hey hey hey! (to chandler) where do you think you're going?, to the bathroom!
6676, oh no! he's not getting away that easy! (phoebe and joey run towards the bathroom and enter), (yelling) what are you doing? get the hell out of here! (phoebe and joey come out looking shocked)
6677," (shocked) oh! well that's it! he's the last one to go. i'm locking you guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)"," you do know, i can just turn them the other way around, right?"
6678," or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..", i'm begging you stop.
6679, (visibly excited) yeah!! let's do that!, (also very excited) that sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in vermont!
6680, ok! i want the dolphin!, thats a bear.
6681," ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)"," ok, on your mark... get set... go!!!"
6682, (to the dog) what are you barking at?  wha... how the hell is that gonna help?, i bought you. how did i forget that that's all you do?
6683," no! no, no... wait! we didn't lose. (turns to chandler) the rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...", they left.
6684," now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size."," i'm sorry, is this a game for emma or for monica?"
6685, game?," emma, you even know it's your birthday today? you're one! one-year-old, that's little.  ooh! that's my girl!"
6686, that's how old you are., did i teach her that? did i just... impart wisdom?
6687," (embraces emma tightly) ooh, i want one...", me too...  there's no-one around. why don't we just take this one?
6688, ...and head to canada!, i was kidding.
6689," hey, are ross and rachel back?"," no, not yet."
6690, i don't care that you left. i'm just glad that you're here. thanks you guys!," hey, guys! come on! you gotta see what emma just did.  emma, how old are you? how old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)"
6691," okay, here we go! emma's first birthday cake... well hey... well, blow out the candle. come on emma."," let's do it, come on!"
6692," u-u-um, i think there's been an oversight."," joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested."
6693," thank you! alright, let me see how i'm gonna start... ""dear baby adoption decider people...""", so excited about your letter!
6694," oh! what's it the anniversary of? your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...", so you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
6695, you guys do that? chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!, that's where people make number two!!
6696," hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to chandler) here. and i think you’ll be very, very happy. it’s the longest i ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.", (reading) i don’t... uh... understand.
6697, of course it does! it’s smart! i used the the-saurus!, on every word?
6698," oh, ‘they are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.", and that became ‘they are humid prepossessing homo sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
6699," hey joey, i don’t think we can use this.  well, because you signed it baby kangaroo tribbiani (joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that' look). hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!"," you know what? you don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump."
6700, hi. i just had the worst anniversary ever., i doubt that! tell her about us last year.
6701," yeah, i really do! yes, but, after i dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, i don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! i mean, i said no in barbados and now this!", she's right! if i were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) did i just say if i were a guy..?
6702," i proposed to chandler! (phoebe stops herself from laughing) alright, moving on..."," oh, i don't think it was desperate, i think it was amazing!"
6703," yeah, that does make sense. ok, now, would... would you two (points to ross and chandler) like that?", sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
6704," um... listen, i couldn't help but overhear... 'cause i was trying to... listen, let me do this alright? i really wanna help you guys out, and plus rachel's been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly)  (very excited) oh! great! so how much does it pay? (ross just gives up and leaves)", hey joe! how's the second draft of the letter coming?
6705, you dropped it off?, can we read it? can you print out another copy?
6706," oh my god, oh my god, that letter is gonna go in our file! we're never gonna get a kid. no, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!"," it's ok, it's ok. you know what? (takes out his mobile) i'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)"
6707, okay good.," (on the phone) hello, this is chandler bing. somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) uh-huh... uh-huh... okay... thank you. good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused)."
6708," ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? you know what? just tell me on the way to the bird store.", (still looks confused) they loved it.  they thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
6709, (surprised) they thought joey was a child?,"she guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings."
6710," ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.", that sounds like fun.
6711," well, if i had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?", i think she looks cute. (rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but i am wrong!
6712, because there are so many terrible sights in this world., like war. or that thing in joey's refrigerator. remember? it was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
6713, (sarcastically) o-okay!, hey! monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
6714," dead. (everyone is a bit upset) oh, it's ok, no, he was old, yeah! and he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at omaha beach."," hey, i'm sorry, i should have given you guys my black book when i got married! although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. with janice's phone number on it."
6715," (proud of herself) oh yes, they are.", (he enters) hey honey!
6716," (looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back. then he closes the door, and we see it's joey.) hi sweetie!"," is monica not here?  oh, then i'll tell you. my agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! it's my first national commercial!"
6717, cool!," yeah, and i don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! (silence) hell, you weren't there? all the ideas were mine!!!"
6718," that's great! hey, can you cast me in it?"," oh... i don't know, i really don't think you're right for the part."
6719," what do you mean? i can do anything, i'm a chameleon! huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) i'm old! (then he yawns) i'm tired! (then he mimes someone who's hot...) hey, i'm hot (...and cold) i'm cold!! huh?? come on! what can't i do?"," first of all. bravo. uh, but i really don't think you're right for this. the part calls for a stuffy college professor."
6720," i can do that! (in a deeper voice) ""hello, i'm your professor. when i'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. i like to use..."" oh, what's the product?", software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
6721," damn it, i did not think this through!", hey you guys.
6722, oh! any word on casting yet?," joe, i told you, you're just not right for the part."
6723," look, c'mon, please? it's not like i'm asking for some crazy favour. this is what i do for a living. i am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) oh, man, i'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). look, here's a copy of my reels. it's got all the commercials that i've been in.", joe...
6724," just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!  thank you. (he sits down)"," work, joe!"
6725, just pass it to your boss!," he's not right for the part. so if i suggest him, my bosses are gonna think i'm an idiot! and that's something they should learn on their own!"
6726," just tell joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys."," that's good! i liked it, they didn't. (he sees joey out of the window hitting on a girl) joey, for god's sake, go to work! (joey runs away)."
6727, what's up?, bad news. i watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
6728, (sounds disappointed) oh., (hands the tape back to him) i'm sorry man.
6729," (looks at him suspiciously) but, ehm... you watched the tape?"," (sounds nervous) yeah! i... i... i liked it! (joey continues to look at him suspiciously) but, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. stupid sons of bitches!"
6730, (sounds confident) you didn't watch the tape., (looks surprised) what!? of course i did!
6731," look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?"," i'm not lying to you, i watched it!"
6732," well, you lied again! (rachel comes out of her room and is observing the conversation)", i watched it!
6733, keep going pinocchio!, (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) i did!
6734, (yelling back) no you didn't! (turns and goes towards his room)," (following him) i'm telling you, i watched the tape. (reaches joey's room and joey slams the door in his face)"
6735, did you watch the tape?,"(in a sarcastic ""of course not""!-tone) no!"
6736, oh come on!!, i can't believe joey. i hate being called a liar!
6737, but you are a liar., what did i just say?
6738, you still here?," yes, and i have to say, i am not just hurt. i am insulted. when i tell somebody i did something..."
6739," ok whoah-hey... let me just stop you right there, ok? first, you lied, right? then, you lied about lying, ok? then you lied about lying about lying, ok? so before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in the air but gives up.) (yelling) stop lying!", why are you so sure i didn't watch this tape?
6740," (comes out holding the tape) here's how i know you didn't watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) if you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. alright, now remember, i got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in japan. (presses play and he appears on the tv screen and a tv commercial begins)  (yelling at chandler) and that's how i know you didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door).", he really is a chameleon.
6741, i want gladys!," look, i'm sorry i didn't give them your tape. and i promise, next time to submit you whether i think you are right for the part or not."
6742, that's not the point chandler. the point is that you lied., i know. you're right. what's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
6743," now, what do you say?", lying is wrong!
6744, and?... and?, i'm a pretty little girl.
6745," oh, figuring out our wedding plans."," that's funny, we were doing the same thing!"
6746," it's really crazy! the hall, the dress, the food... i-i had no idea how expensive this stuff was!"," yeah it is really pricey. i mean, i freaked when i first heard the numbers."
6747, so what did you two do about it?," it was pretty simple actually, i came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell."
6748," i've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!", (to ross) maybe you do that next time you get married!
6749, (sarcastically) we?, you know you don't want me to help. you can't have it both ways!
6750," hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?", kind of. she's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
6751," hey, maybe i should stop by! she could be a soap opera fan! it's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.", (pointing at himself) little people?
6752," ok, so i think i'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?"," what...? no!  (he stands up and he feels very offended) i don't, and i'm offended by the insinuation!"
6753," ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the vcr?"," i'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine."
6754," oh my god, the adoption lady is early!"," ok, ok, here we go.  here we go. stand up straight. (smiling) big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)"
6755," it’s ok, it’s ok. i made my decision. what i really want is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)", but you already gave all your money to charity!
6756," well, i’ll just ask for it back!", i don’t think you can do that!
6757," why not! this is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!"," that’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady."
6758, ok. great. i am so glad that you are here. we’re really excited about getting this process started.," oh, because we love kids. love ‘em to death.well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law."
6759, is that that couple on the first floor? because we should get a baby before," but other than that... wholesome, wholesome building."
6760," yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call", rat bastard!
6761, what was that?," oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. he's great with"
6762," guys? everything ok? it's me, joe...", (screams to interrupt joey) aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......aaaaaa-doption!!
6763, keep on roaming bert! we don't want any crazy today!," we'll talk to you later, bert. everythng's fine!!"
6764, is he alright out there by himself?, oh yeah! he has a caretaker. his older brother... ernie.
6765, bert and ernie!, (nervous smile) you can't make this stuff up!
6766, (pulls laura into the spare room) why don't i show you the baby's room?, what the hell are you doing?
6767," well, you wouldn't let me in, so i thought you were in trouble."," well, we're not."
6768, but you called me 'bert'!? that's our code word for danger!, we don't have a code word.
6769, so that was the baby's room. (they come out and chandler throws joey behind  (to chandler) what room should we see next?, any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)
6770, (quivering with anger) i did not care for that!, (escorting joey to the door) you have to get out of here. you slept with
6771, are you friends with him?, i can explain... joey...
6772, (laughing nervously) i'm sorry that you had to see that. i'm so embarrassed...," oh, that's really ok."
6773," hello...? oh hi... oh my god...! really...? i can't wait to tell chandler... ok, goodbye. (hangs up)", wrong number?
6774, it was laura... she gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list., that's great!
6775, now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. oh..., hello...? have you seen joey's bat?
6776, hey guys!  we need to talk to you about something., yeah. we don't feel like we can host thanksgiving this year.
6777, are you kidding?," well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us."
6778, (skeptical) that doesn't sound like you... that's monica talking!," no, no! we made this decision together."
6779," that's my favourite kind! okay, we are doing this!", don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
6780," hey, stay out of this, chandler! this is between me... and me!", we are supposed to make these decisions together! did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you?
6781, (chandler's laughing) did someone drop the baton again?, why come all the way from kansas to do that?
6782, (she tastes what she has cooked) i don't get older. i just get better!," you know what just occurred to me? this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us. i mean, we could be getting a baby soon!"
6783, you don't know that., somebody is gonna pick us.
6784," yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!"," i'm telling ya! it's gonna happen. next year it's gonna be you, me and the little hemingway bing. (pause) what, he's my favourite author!"
6785, name one of his books.," (after a long pause) ""the firm""?"
6786," ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready..."," you know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. let me help this year."
6787," oh, chandler, that's sweet. but you don't have to do everything doctor phil tells you to do."," i'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile""."
6788," ok, let's see... oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.", tell me more.
6789," okay, i'm gonna go check on something across the hall. you start by washing these (she gives chandler a bowl with cranberries. then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) not with soap!! (she leaves)", you obviously haven't tasted my palmolive potatoes!
6790, did i do something to you?," hmm, the game's at one."
6791, so?," dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back."
6792," so we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time."," you say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up."
6793," dude, two times that happened!"," look, monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!"
6794," right, i guess. alright, so see you at four.", okay. (pause) and get ready to taste my very special cranberries. or should i say... chanberries!
6795, where is everybody? they're forty-five minutes late!, i can't believe they are not here! i slave and i slave for what? they've ruined cranberry day!
6796, do you hear something? (chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole), (peeping) they're out there!
6797," ohhh! let me see! oh god, i can't believe this! they're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!"," (peeping) everything is so distorted! looks like joey has a giant hand! which says ""rangers"" on it. they went to the game!"
6798, (gasps) oooh! they are in for a world of pain!, (looking through the peephole again) ross' shirt is torn.
6799, no! everything's cold. the turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.," yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?"
6800, (rolling her eyes) nothing. it's fine., (relieved) oh thank god!
6801," come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? our subway broke down."," (looking through the peephole) that's a lie, you went to the game, i can see joey's hand."
6802," hey, you touch that and you will be sorry."," guys, i'd listen to her. the vein is bigger than i've ever seen it. (monica looks at chandler)"
6803, that's worse than no food., ha-ha! all you got was monica's stinky brussels sprouts!
6804, stinky?!, please let me stay on this side of the door.
6805," oh! it all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...", the cranberries...?
6806," (still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at monica and chandler as he did with ross earlier in the hall) hey listen guys, we feel really terrible."," he's doing that weird eye contact thing. don't look at him, don't look at him! (they both look away)"
6807," (smiling) now let's not ruin this day. you worked so hard. let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?", the floating heads do make a good point.
6808," really girls, not cool."," well, you manheads aren't any better. you lied about going to the game. you knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway."
6809, fine! let's just go. i don't need your stupid dinner., that would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
6810, (in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh stop! stop! i'm worried about damaging my head., a little late for that.
6811," alright, well, this does not change anything. (to chandler) okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face."," uhm, we've got turkey grease."
6812," well hurry, i can't feel my ears!", can you ever feel your ears?
6813," chandler, where are your tools?"," (sarcastically) oh, i left them on my bulldozer... i don't have tools!"
6814, it's really starting to hurt.," okay, look, i'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? okay, so push!"
6815, ooh! stop putting things down my pants!," come on guys, push!"
6816, push! push! push!, my cranberries!
6817," (looking at himself) man, i've got food all over me.", argh! i can't believe what you did. monica's gonna kill you!  (to monica) look! look! look what the... look what... look what the floating heads did!
6818, (very emotional) i don't care., what's going on?
6819, that was the adoption agency...  we're getting a baby!, are you serious? (they hug)
6820," oh, i know how you feel...  sure. i went through the exact same thing with alicia mae emory... the waiting, the wandering... then one day... i get that call from toys ""r"" us... she was in stock!"," that is the exact same thing.  we're just here to say goodbye, we're off to ohio."
6821," i can't believe it. when you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! that is so weird!", and so incorrect!
6822," come on, she's gonna love you guys!"," uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up."
6823, and a lot could still get in our way.," yeah. i mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.."
6824, what are you gonna name the baby?, i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word.
6825, oh my god. she's gonna pick us!, so we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
6826," you know, i know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? if this works out, we're gonna have a baby chandler, a baby!"," yes, but..."
6827," oh my god, it's gonna work! we're gonna make it work! i'm gonna be a mummy and (to chandler) you're gonna be a daddy! all right, i'll see you suckers. i'm gonna get me... a baby! {she leaves)"," oh, screw it, i'm gonna be a daddy!!"
6828," ok, thank you.(the man leaves) uh, well this is it. are you ok?"," yeah. just weird, you know. it's like: ""hi, i'm chandler. may i have the human growing inside you?"""
6829," uh, we're gonna be great.", you're gonna be great.
6830, (whispering) hi..., thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
6831,"so, it's monica and chandler. i only know you as file 0w33815-d.", that's what our friends call us.
6832," you're kidding me? i mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. but on top of it, you're married to a reverend?", (astonished) i don't think that's exactly...
6833, (to phoebe) why do men keep talking to me like this?," so, the fact that i am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?"
6834, amen., plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
6835, wow.," yeah, wow."
6836, (to chandler) being a doctor must take up a lot of time., no-ot for me it doesn’t.
6837, do you have any question for erica?," yeah, actually. so, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?"
6838," yes, our system assures total anonimity. we’re very proud of it.", you should be. you’re really on top of stuff..
6839," oh my god, this is great! this is so great! (to chandler, who looks bewildered). did you hear that?"," yeah, i did."
6840," you're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) i have a date. (as he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) see? (to joey) all eyes on me!", we are not signing those papers.  it's wrong. they made a mistake. they think we're somebody else.
6841, god works in mysterious ways., you have gotta stop!
6842, but she liked us., she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica.
6843," well, if you think about it, i am kind of like a reverend. i mean, as a chef, i serve god, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)","your veal chop is $34,95!"
6844," c'mon chandler, i think we have been given an opportunity. i mean, the mistake has already been made. they are writing up the paper right now.", but we are not the one she chose! how can you feel okay about this?
6845, (very emotional) because... we may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us., i know..
6846," i mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? what if, what if no one ever picks us?"," oh, honey.."
6847," (almost crying) please.. please, we are so close."," monica, i want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. she deserves to know who it's going to."
6848," (realizes chandler is right. she's almost crying) okay, right. (they hug)"," so, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us."
6849, (sniffing) maybe she will. uh! why couldn't i have been a reverend?, you're jewish.
6850, i don't understand., the agency must have made some mistake. my wife is not a reverend and i'm not a doctor.
6851, that's impossible., i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
6852, so who are you?," well, our names really are monica and chandler. we're from new york."
6853, i don't want to look at your file! this is over., erica wait!
6854, i've nothing to say to you. (walks a few paces), you have every reason to be upset. we did lie. but only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
6855, why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?," erica, please. just consider us. ask them to see our file. our last name's bing. my wife's a chef and i'm in advertising."
6856," oh yeah. i actually liked you guys. but it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away again, but chandler catches up with her again)"," but you did like us. and you should. my wife's an incredible woman. she's loving and devoted and caring. and don't tell her i said this but the woman's always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i can't give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, i'll learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she's already there. she's a mother... without a baby... please?  you still want that baby?"
6857, (with no hesitation) sex!," (looking at her) seriously, answer faster!"
6858," oh, i'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said ""sex"" i wasn't thinking about ""sex with you""!", (to phoebe) it's like a giant hug.
6859," oh yeah? well, let's see. (she takes her mobile phone) ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. phoebe calls chandler)", (picking up the phone) hello.
6860," oh, hi chandler. it's phoebe. uhm... i know that monica is working today so...(back to central perk) ...i was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and rachel."," oh, uhm... i have to work too. yeah, i'm stuck at the office all day."
6861," (shocked) oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either ""liar, liar"" or ""betrayal"", or... ""an affair to remember"".", those are all really old!
6862, hey! you smell like perfume and cigarettes., i was in the car with nancy all day.
6863, nancy doesn’t smoke!," well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!"
6864, so? what do you think of the house?, it’s perfect. it’s everything we’ve been looking for.
6865, isn’t it? then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?, and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) what were the things you said?
6866, don’t you love the huge yard?, and the fireplace in the bedroom.
6867," and nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!", this is bringing out a lovely color in you!
6868, so? do you think we should get it?, i don’t know. what do you think?
6869, i think we should., i do too.
6870, this is huge!, i know.
6871," how bad you wanna smoke, right now."," i don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! oh, by the way, phoebe called just as i was getting into nancy’s car, so if she asks you, i was at work all day."
6872, gotcha. when do we tell them about this?," we don’t. not until it's a hundred percent. i mean, why upset everybody over nothing."
6873, okay. right. oh my god that is gonna be so hard., i know. gooooood luck with it.
6874, (to chandler) you son of a bitch!," is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?"
6875," (turns to them) ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.", yeah (motions them to sit and they do) i'm not having an affair. nancy is our realtor.
6876," and that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...", ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
6877," (to joey) it's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to mon and chan), but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be."," actually, we already found a house we love."
6878," and about an hour ago, we made an offer."," bet you wish i was having an affair now, huh?"
6879," wha..? again with the nature, what are you? beavers?", i know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
6880," is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food? (walks towards the fridge) because i can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) i really, really think i can!"," (goes towards joey) you know that's not the reason joe. (joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. he goes back to where he was standing before)"
6881," you guys, you know what i just realized? 'joker' is 'poker' with a 'j.' coincidence?"," hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'c'!"
6882, oooohh that’s interesting.," if you win, we give up the birds."
6883, (shocked) dah!! (chandler motions for him to calm down.)," but if we win, we get your apartment."
6884, correct. rachel claims this is her favorite movie…, dangerous liaisons.
6885, everyday use., fancy.
6886, guest., fancy guest.
6887," two seconds... 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct. (the guys celebrate.)  (to the girls) chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?", thanks man.
6888, don’t blame the questions!, would you all stop yelling in our apartment! you are ruining moving day for us!
6889," chandler!!! chandler!!! (he opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; chandler and monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) chandler, i saw what you were doing through the window! chandler, i saw what you were doing to my sister! now get out here!"," (to monica) wow! listen, we had a good run. you know, what was it? four? five months? i mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! so, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (he kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)"
6890," (running from the guy's apartment with joey in tow) hey, what's-what's going on?!"," well, i think, i think ross knows about me and monica."
6891," (to chandler) i thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! my best friend and my sister! i-i cannot believe this!"," look, we're not just messing around! i love her. okay, i'm in love with her."
6892," and when i told her that i was gonna be moving in with chandler, she was really supportive. (to rachel) (starts to cry) you were so great. you made it so easy. and now you have to leave. and i have to live with a boy!! (they both break down in tears.)", (entering) hey.
6893, she really left., i know. (he kisses her.)  no problem roomie. (she turns around and hugs him.)
6894, can i ask you a question?, sure!
6895, what the hell is that dog doing here?! (she notices the dog sitting in the living room.)," little toast here. i know this isn't exactly the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked."
6896, and a crappy new year.," here, here!"
6897," yeah. so don't move, okay? just stay here and... (nods towards ross) maybe close your blinds at night."," hello? it's nancy, they responded to our offer."
6898, and?," (to nancy) okay, thanks... (to monica) they passed. they said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price."
6899," you know, i'm really sorry i wasn't more supportive before."," that's okay, we understand."
6900," i know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... i love that one so much."," yeah... well, it's a good thing we got it then.  we got the house.  i just didn't want to tell you in front of them."
6901, oh my god! my god! we've got the house !?, we're getting the house. (they hug) we're getting the house.
6902, and a baby..., we're growing up.
6903, we sure are., so who's gonna tell them?
6904, (quickly) not it!, not it! damn it!
6905, aah! why? what are these for?, you'll see.
6906," seriously you guys, what's going on? what are these for?"," well, i didn't know how to tell you before, but... we got the house."
6907," or ""win, lose or draw"".", what did i marry into?
6908, ross and i always wanted to be donny and marie., you guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
6909," (singing) ""...and i'm a little bit rock 'n' roll""!", (to monica) i'm leaving you.
6910," so weird to see all these people again... oh my god, look, there's geoffrey cleric.", who?
6911, he was roommates with john rosoff. he went out with andrea tamburino. she dumped him for michael skloff., (looking around) did i go to this school?
6912," hey, there's missy goldberg. you gotta remember her."," (looks over at her) sure, nice."
6913, dude. you're married to my sister.," you're right, by saying ""nice"" i'm virtually licking her."
6914," hey, i hear she's single again, d'you think i should ask her out?", are you asking permission to break the pact?
6915," yes please.  hey. hey, check out the flyers for the band. i made 'em on a macintosh in the computer room!"," awesome, the name really stands out."
6916,"thanks to a little something called ""helvetica bold 24 point""!"," man, we're gonna rock that asian student union!"
6917," hey, missy..."," you know, our band is playing on friday."
6918, right. i'll be there. (she leaves), fresh!
6919, boss!, mint!
6920, she's gone.," i know it. you know, i'm totally gonna ask her out."
6921," dude, i was gonna ask her out."," i said it first, bro."
6922," well, i thought it first, holmes."," (angrily) look, if you did..."
6923," woha! wait... what are we doing? what we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. i mean, we can get laid anytime we want.", totally. i had sex in high school...
6924, me too. i'm good at it.," all right, i'd say we make a pact. neither of us will go out with missy goldberg.  all right, so that's missy goldberg, phoebe cates and molly ringwald, who neither of us can go out with."
6925, those are the pacts!," oh, and sheena easton. but we probably couldn't get her anyway."
6926," oh, oh... maybe not you!"," well, i officially give you permission to break the pact."
6927," thank you. (they shake hands) all right, here i go. hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?", your hands are shaking.
6928," (to chandler) you made out with missy goldberg. how could you do that, after you promised me?", (to the two guys) excuse me. (chandler and ross move away from them). that didn't make us sound gay at all!
6929, you broke the pact!,"ross, that was 16 years ago!"
6930, that doesn't matter! we're talking about the foundation of our friendship.," i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (ross just stares at him) all right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts."
6931, i didn't., oh really?  oh really!?  adrienne turner!! (a girl behind them turns around)
6932, i never did anything with adrienne turner.," oh please, and you knew how much i liked her."
6933, i don't know what... you're talking about., really?
6934," well lets see. maybe he knows where ross is. (they walk towards chandler) hey, how's it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).", aren't you...?
6935," yeah, rachel. and this (points to monica) is ross' sister, monica. we met at thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).", (smiling at monica) right. (to rachel) so how're you doing?
6936, hi chandler. it's really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) not. (she and rachel giggle a little and chandler looks unimpressed), o-kay. i'll see if i can find ross. (goes off to find ross.)
6937, cool! (they start kissing again and chandler looks shocked)  i didn't know you knew about that.," well, i did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) that's when i wrote the song: ""betrayal in the common room""."
6938, (looks disappointed in himself) man... i... i'm sorry., look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
6939," so, eh. i made out with adrienne and you made out with missy. well i guess we're even.", (smiling a little nervously) hmm mmmhm..
6940," we are even, right?"," (sighs) just one more thing. i was so pissed at you that night that i wanted to get back at you. so i thought, who does ross like the more than anybody?"
6941, (thinks about it for a few seconds) what did you do to my mom?, not her!
6942, that's weird. i've had the same number of beers as you and i don't feel anything at all. (chandler approaches), soo... you girls having fun?
6943, (finishing the last of her drink) i am soo not going to do good on my sats tomorrow., well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
6944, (sarcastic) oh yeah. there is a plan! why don't i just start taking my smart pills now?," well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship."
6945," (blushing) oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards chandler and whispers ""oh my god!"")", so where are you applying to?
6946," oh well, you know, i think it's kinda really important that i go somewhere where there's sun, so i'm sort of... (chandler leans in an kisses her) (she pulls away) hey!", i'm in college and i'm in a band.
6947, oh my god! that's wild!," yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter."
6948," well, it matters to me.  because... the night you kissed rachel was the night i kissed rachel for the very first time.", you kissed her that night too?
6949," two guys in one night? wow, i thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed."," seriously, where did this happen?"
6950," okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, i went in there to make sure she was all right. she was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. well, i went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. but it was so dark, i accidentally got her lips. i started to pull away, but then i felt her start to kiss me back. it was only for a second, but... it was amazing. and now, now i find out that you kissed her first.", oh wait... what bed did you say she was on?  i'm pretty sure i put her on my bed.
6951," no, she was definitely on my bed."," why would i kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?"
6952, (looking angry) hey! she will shower when tibet is free.," you look great. i'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, i so rarely get to practice my meals before i eat them."
6953," okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?", no stupid jokes. i thought that was for the actual wedding.
6954," hey, i'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? but i'm just trying to be nice for the kids!", (to rachel) you know what i just realized? we have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
6955, uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet., heh.
6956," oh, man!", this is like figure skating team all over again. (phoebe and ross glare at him astonished) i mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) i mean- i mean the balance beam. (to ross) help me!
6957, i can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.," i know, i hate being left out of things."
6958," hey guys, how is it going?", fine. we're just sitting here. alone. doing nothing. it's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
6959," yeah look, about tomorrow, i... i've got a question for ya. i just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.", what happened?
6960, i'll do it!, (standing up too) m-me-me-me!
6961, you both wanna do it? uhm... there's only room for one.," pick me, i look great in a tux and i will not steal focus."
6962," (to chandler) well, if phoebe's choosing, then say hello to mike's next groomsman."," oh, i will. but i will need a mirror... as he is me!"
6963," please, you're going down!", you are going downer!
6964, is that what they say on the figure skating team?," (almost crying) i wouldn't know, i didn't make it! (they hug)"
6965, i decided to pee., mike didn't tell you? you have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. one of his groomsmen fell out.
6966," oh no, no. i can't choose between you two! i love you both so much!", just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
6967, hi," hey, can i talk to you about this groomsman thing? if you pick ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. but if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!"
6968," even so, i think i'm gonna pick ross."," let me tell you why you need to pick me. (goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) see, when i was a kid, i was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. you know, i was always picked last in gym. even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. i mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. anyway, if i'm the only one left out of this wedding, i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back."
6969," all right fine, i pick you."," (getting up and raising his fist in victory) y-y-yeeesss! make ""groom"" for chandler."
6970, (staring at the ice sculpture) how bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? (they all glare at him), how's it going?
6971, (smiling to himself) good. i'm just getting some coffee. so i'm alert for the wedding., (smiling to himself too) that's what i was doing too.
6972," (barely containing himself at this point) well, you have fun tonight.", you too.
6973," oh, i will.", me too.
6974," wait a minute, i know why i'm being such an ass, why are you?", i'm not supposed to tell you.
6975, i'm not supposed to tell you!, you told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at rachel)
6976," rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. you and me together again. (he winks at her and rachel looks disgusted)"," rach, rach, knock knock."
6977, who's there?, i'll tell you at the wedding.
6978," (to chandler and ross) you know, chappy's too small to handle all this snow. someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle."," so technically, would this person be in the wedding?"
6979," no, but chandler, hello... aren't you scared of dogs?", i'm not scared. (moves towards mike and chappy) i'll just take little chappy and... (he backs out) he can sense my fear. my throat is exposed.
6980," okay, if joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the isle.", (quickly) i'll do it.
6981, i'll...," (to ross) na ha ha... (to chappy) ne he he... (ross moves chappy to chandler, who quickly backs away) ah ah..."
6982, okay. (in her microphone) it's zero hour. all teams execute on my count. (to all) let's get this bad boy on the road., (to monica) is it okay that i want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
6983,(checking her clipboard) i have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours., oh yeah! (monica walks outside)
6984," groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) we've got a broken arrow. bridesmaid down! (realizes) oh, that's me.", ready?
6985, (nervously) okay., okay.
6986," oh wait, oh no. wait.", wow! aren't you gonna be cold?
6987, i don't care... i'll be my something blue., you look beautiful.
6988," i got married! (everyone applauds) could someone get me a coat, i'm freaking freezing.", that really was an incredible wedding.
6989," it was, yeah. i kind of don't want it to end. hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?","i'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and i'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had."
6990," nice. oh hey, what about ross?", i don't know. maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
6991, how was the honeymoon?," so, where's mike?"
6992," seriously stop it, or i'm gonna jump on ya.", why are you wearing my apron?
6993," i'm making cookies for erica. and oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour."," oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if i introduce you two as ""my wife"" and ""the woman who's carrying my child""? (she's not amused) no? divorce?"
6994," well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to new york so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, statue of liberty, empire state building..."," oh, those places! there's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes ""mooooo""!"
6995, honey., i'm so sorry...
6996," (entering with erica and chandler) hey you guys.  i want you to meet someone really special. phoebe, this is erica. and this is the baby!  joey. erica, baby!  everyone. erica, baby!"," monica. calm, self."
6997," welcome to new york city! or should i say ""ghe deu flooff new york city""?", why would you say that?
6998," oh yeah, let's do that!", great! (to monica) this baby'd better to be really good.
6999," oh, i'm glad. listen, i want to apologize about chandler, though. i just did not see this coming."," (enters the room wearing an ""i love new york"" t-shirt, a ""statue of liberty"" hat and carrying bags) new york is awesome!"
7000, what is with you?," yeah, i've been to these places before, but i've never really seen them, you know."
7001," well, if there is anything else you wanna know... (monica and chandler look at each other)"," oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?"
7002," oh, sure. yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. (monica and chandler are smiling from ear to ear)", that's great.
7003," well, there is a chance it's another guy. i mean, i have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped."," so, what does the other guy do? does he go to college too?"
7004," no... he killed his father with a shovel. (monica and chandler's jaws drop) but other than that, he's a great guy.", i'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
7005, are you awake?, of course i'm awake. assume from now on that i'm always awake! (he turns the light on)
7006," alright, we don't know that it's him. i mean, it could be the football guy."," honey, it's us. of course it's the shovel-killer."
7007," alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? no! would we treat him any differently?", i'd keep an eye on him! we have to find out which one the father is.
7008, how?," i dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?"
7009," yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting."," pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. he probably loves him mommy. he's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm!"
7010," hey you know what? you know what? to avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.  that's right, sex is off the table. (the door starts to open behind him and dr. green emerges) i am never having sex with you again. (rachel stays quiet and after a few moments ross realizes what has happened. he turns abruptly) dr. green, are you feeling better? (rachel's dad glares at him with a deadly look)", hey! how was lunch?
7011," (to chandler) we had a good time. by the way, i wanted to ask you something. it would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, jiminy billy bob (monica smiles at chandler and his he looks shocked and scared, getting no support from his wife)"," (struggling) oh, really?"
7012," no! (to monica) you we're right, that was fun! i'm gonna go finish packing."," o-okay. (steps closer to monica and speaks softly) so, is she gonna take the test?"
7013," nope, she doesn't have to, i found out who the father is."," oh god. it's shovely-joe, isn't it?"
7014, (smiling) no it's not., how do you know?
7015," well, it turns out that erica didn't pay much attention in sex ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.", oh god! what was it? the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
7016, the thing we never do., (nods in appreciation) shovely joe!
7017," oh! yeah, this is fun, couples night."," yeah, i don't know why we hang out with married couples more often."
7018," well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away."," you mean that portuguese couple? yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)"
7019," oh, well, er, i already ate, but sure...! (they all look at each other when ross grabs a plate) guess what happened at work today...", a dinosaur died a million years ago?
7020, uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau..., you never did it!
7021, i'm sorry. it's just the idea of being an official bing.," hey! i will have you know that... aah, who am i kidding. let's call the kid geller and let bing die with me."
7022," all right, let's see, call me mrs hannigan.", mrs hannigan?
7023, (enters) hey guys., hey joe! we've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. you want to come with us?
7024," all right. i know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house."," yeah, come with us. you'll see how close it is to the city."
7025," you know what? you are my friends, i wanna be supportive, i will come with you. shotgun!", damn it.
7026," wrong again! apparently you can change it to anything you want. so i thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. so meet princess consuela banana hammock.", that's what we were gonna name the baby.
7027," uhm, no. i'm gonna have my friends call me valerie."," hey, how'd the interview go?"
7028, oh! it's not good.," you know, i always feel that way after an interview. i'll bet it went better than you think."
7029," well, i didn't get the job at gucci and i got fired from ralph lauren.", that is a bad interview.
7030," oh, i thought joey was here. five is good. (gunther leaves, hurt) well, i'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.", ooh! israeli champagne. and it's vanilla!
7031, ...that center around work., to ross!
7032, thank you for letting us see the house again.," and thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... i've already forgotten what you said, but thank you."
7033, (squinting his eyes) are you kiddin'? i think i just saw a bat in the corner!," when your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?"
7034," oh, i love this street. the trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences."," man, those two dogs are going at it!"
7035," oh, just er... you know, looking around. but you know what? this house... is great.", really? what changed your mind?
7036," oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.","joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago."
7037, (frightened) what?, ha! i'm just messing with you.
7038, what? i get my own room?, you don't think we'd buy a house and not have a joey room do you?
7039, that guy mark. from bloomingdale's... she thinks he's just being nice to her. but i know he really wants to sleep with her., it's seven years ago. (he looks surprised) my time machine works!
7040," so what if he wants to sleep with her? i mean, she's single and he's cute.  oh please! yesterday on the subway? you couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time."," for your information, i was staring at her baby. we're about to be parents."
7041, should we send something?, how did the job stuff go?
7042, he offered me one., that's great!
7043, previously on friends..., how did the job stuff go?
7044, so if you take this job you'll be moving to paris?, or facing a bitch of a commute.
7045," i know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. and i've already talked to them about our situation with emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.  i mean, i'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... anything we want.", my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (monica looks at him and can't really place what he just said)
7046, you okay with this?," well, it makes me feel sad, but..."
7047, how is that gonna happen?, is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
7048," hey phoebe. hey, tell me what you think. all right. the house next door to the one that we're buying in westchester? just went on the market. i wanna take a look at it, but chandler doesn't."," we close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. we're not very bright."
7049, but what if it is better than ours? should we at least look?, what do you think pheebs?
7050," well, i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins... anyway... hey, isn't joey's agent estelle leonard?  she died.", you're kidding!
7051, joey's gonna be *so* upset., i know. *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic.
7052, what if he reads it in the paper?," unless snoopy says it to charlie brown, i think we're okay."
7053," oh, sure. i’m showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around."," it feels like we’re cheating on our house. and if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do?"
7054, what a small world!, and yet i never run into beyonce!
7055," oh, we go way back. before monica made an honest man out of him, chandler used to be my little love muffin! (does her irritating laugh). so? are you guys thinking of getting this house too? ooh! are we gonna have a bidding war? i'd better warn you, i'm a toughie (playfully punches chandler, who tries to get away from her)"," (at janice's punching) don't, don't! (looks disgusted)"
7056," no, actually, we're buying the house next door. (janice gasps)", (to monica and with bulging eyes) why!?
7057," ooh, that decides it then. i was on the fence. but knowing that you two would be our neighbors? ah! now we have to get it! (chandler and monica are utterly shocked) ellen, we're going to talk numbers. (grabs ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside)", this can not be happening!
7058," okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. maybe the janice's won't get it! maybe the other couple will."," the only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the hitlers."
7059," (thinks a little more) okay, okay, (clapping her hands) all right. what if we got both houses? huh? we can turn this house into a guest house."," that is a great idea! and by the way, i don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?"
7060," okay, you come up with an idea."," alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. we can still get out."
7061, but we love our house.," will we love it so much with her next door? and she's gonna be louder out here too. just the crickets and (apes janice's voice) ""oh my god""!"
7062," okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! i mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. i mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body. (she shows this with her index finger, mimicking it pushing something up)"," (looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) well, we have to do something. we can't have her living next door. (janice's laughs loudly outside) oh, that does it too. (motions with his index finger like monica did)"
7063," well... i just talked to sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and i'll bet we get it.", the hitlers will be so disappointed.
7064," all right, i got to run. tell monica i say goodbye. and... i'll see you later, neighbor. (janice laugh)", wait! i just want you to know that... i'm so happy you're going to be here.
7065," oh, me too... (laughs)", because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
7066, huh?, i never stopped loving you.
7067, oh... my...," yeah, yeah, yeah! i want you... i need you... i must have you janice litman goralnik neihosenstein."
7068," chandler, what are you talking about?"," now that you live next door, we can be together every day. sid and monica never have to know a thing."
7069," i don't know what to say... i mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.", (stunned) obviously.
7070," but i love my husband. and i know you love your wife. now, i don't think we should get this house now.", don't say that. don't tangle the dream and take it away.
7071," chandler, one of us has got to be strong.", i understand.
7072," although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... (she kisses chandler flat on the mouth. chandler squirms. when she's finished, he looks at her lovingly but uneasily.) goodbye chandler bing. (she leaves)", (speaking as in pain) they're never coming down now.
7073, damnit!, so we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
7074, oh my god! i have nothing left to teach you! (they hug), where's your passport?
7075, it should be right next to my plane ticket.," well, it's not."
7076," are, are you kidding? this is packing?", we're taking a break!
7077, from?, jumping on the bed?
7078," you got it! (monica leaves, ross closes the door). all right, she's right, we gotta get serious. (he grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!"," no, no, no, guys. she's right. we should get to work. i'll take stuff out of the closet, joey you pack 'em and ross you re-pack whatever joey packs."
7079, you guys hear a ringing?, (holding a pair of furry handcuffs) what the hell is this?
7080," chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.", i didn't know monica had these!
7081," mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. maybe richard!", why would she use them with richard and not me? i can be kinky! i once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
7082," oh, man! i can't believe she's actually leaving. how am i gonna say goodbye to rachel?"," i know, she's been such a big part of my life. and it feels like when melrose place got cancelled. (ross and joey looks puzzled) i mean... oh, forget it. i miss melrose place!"
7083," who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? head she wins, tails i lose. (he stops and starts realizing something) wait a minute..."," yes, joe?"
7084, chandler? i was just in our bedroom and i found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.," oh, yes. i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!"
7085, what are you talking about? these aren't mine.," oh yeah, right! good luck getting another scarf dance from me!"
7086," that would be a terrible punishment. but, i'm serious, i've never seen these before.", really? then what are they doing in our guestroom?
7087, rachel used to live in that room., rachel... with handcuffs! interesting! (he looks excited)
7088, joey's bare ass!, (he doesn't look excited anymore). well played.
7089," (to joey) oh no, she took down monica... and i'm the crier in the family. oh god! i could be next. maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. oh, so that thing you said about the thing. it really made me think about that other thing."," uh, rach?"
7090, i really made you think about that thing uh?," (to rachel) uh, rach... i think i have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)"
7091," (laughs) oh, i'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i don't get."," no, no, no... they're really yours. we... found them in your old room."
7092," well, these aren't mine. maybe monica used to use them with..."," don't say richard! well, if they're not monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?"
7093," well, i think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.", pheebs!
7094, (from the other side of the room) yeah!, i think these are yours.
7095, (to chandler) can i talk to you alone for a minute?, sure. (to phoebe) you don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
7096, oh honey...," let me just say something... because once we get into this, i'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... i just want to say that i... i love you... and, i'm gonna miss you. and i'm so sad that you're leaving."
7097," (all mushy) oh, you know what? let's not say anything else. i love you. (they hug)"," ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) i'm sorry, just give me one more chance."
7098, okay. oh...," i'm sor... just go. just go. i can't, i can't."
7099, i don't think so.," oh, you're definately not. i haven't cried like that in years."
7100, you cried yesterday at the six o'clock news., that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
7101, yeah. mine too., mine was a humdinger
7102, tell me about it.," well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party."
7103, we're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. it would be great if you guys could pitch in., joey and i can finish up in the guest room.
7104, oh no! you and phoebe are gonna help me in here., (to joey) you couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
7105," good! now i need you to be careful and efficient. and remember, if i am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong."," hey mon, i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are."
7106, you did? how?," well, i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them... being used."
7107, who's that dirty old lady?, monica's grandmother.
7108," yeah, you know, maybe i ate too much. i keep getting these stomach aches. they come and go like every few minutes.", relax! we just get her some antacids.
7109," all right, chandler get the coats. erica let's go. phoebe and joey, keep packing! oh my god we're gonna have a baby. all right. we're gonna have a baby! oh my god, we're gonna have a baby! oh god, oh god, i got to sit down, i got to sit down. ooh! (she's hyperventilating)"," honey, it's gonna be okay."
7110," yeah, you know, maybe i ate too much. i keep getting these stomach-aches. they come and go like every few minutes.", relax! we'll just get her some antacids.
7111," breathe, breathe, breathe... good."," next time, can i say breathe?"
7112," alright, i'll be right back.", where are you going?
7113, to use the bathroom., you can't leave me alone with her.  this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with!
7114, what kind of social situation are you comfortable with?," it's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together."
7115," you'll be fine. nah, you won't, but i'll be back in two minutes."," so, ah... any plans for the summer?"
7116, i don't know. maybe church-camp?," hah. may not wanna mention this. so, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?"
7117, help me! this hurts!, is it really that bad?
7118," oh! oh my god! that is the most beautiful top of a head i have ever seen! chandler, you have to see this!", i'm okay.
7119," chandler, you don't wanna miss this. this is the birth of your child! it's the miracle of life!"," alright. wow, that is one disgusting miracle."
7120," oh, you did it!", (emotional) it's a baby! a beautiful little baby! and some other stuff i'm gonna pretend i don't see.
7121, would you like to cut the umbilical cord?," well, that's spongy."
7122," (to her son) oh, hey handsome! oh, i'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (to chandler, on the verge of tears) oh, we are so lucky!"," i know. he has your eyes.  i mean, i know that's not possible, but he does."
7123, i'm really happy for you guys., how do you feel?
7124," you know it's twins, right?"," oh, yeah! these are the faces of two people in the know!"
7125, i can't believe you didn't know it's twins! this has never happened before.," well, gosh. that makes me feel so special and good."
7126, twins actually run in my family., interesting! (to monica) can i see you for a second?  what do we do?
7127," what do you mean ""what do we do""?", (panicking) twins! twins!!
7128," chandler, you're panicking!"," uh-huh! join me, won't you?! okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?"
7129, we can't split them up!," why not? we could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. i mean, that's a great day for everybody."
7130," okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?", what if they're not? what if it's adopted by a king?
7131," yeah, because i hear the king is looking to adopt."," monica, we are not ready to have two babies!"
7132," that doesn't matter! we have waited so long for this. i don't care if it's two babies. i don't care if it's three babies! i don't care if the entire cast of ""eight is enough"" comes out of there! we are taking them home, because they are our children!", (smiles) okay. shhh...
7133, okay!, okay!
7134, here she comes!, (shocked) she? it's a girl?
7135, do you think they recognize each other from in there?," maybe. unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet."
7136, bye!, bye!
7137," oh, look at these little bunnies!", i know! you ready to trade?
7138," okay.  alright, let's see..", we could trade later.
7139," (points at the baby she's holding) this is a boy, (points at the baby chandler is holding) and that's a girl.", her name is erica.
7140," hey, that pregnant girl's name was erica.", yeah. it's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
7141, i love you., i love you.
7142, this is so cool!," i have no idea what's going on, but i am excited!"
7143," quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack..."," we were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this."
7144," okay, i wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, i got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!", really? you got us a chick and a duck?
7145," yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!"," oh, don't worry, we'll find them."
7146," actually, i'm gonna go check on the twins.  oh god! what did i just step on?"," it's okay, it's just an egg roll."
7147, just put it on a plate and leave.," okay, let's find these birds."
7148," alright.  wait, wait. do you hear that?  oh! they're in the table!"," well, that can't be good!"
7149, we gotta get them out of there!, how?
7150," oh, oh! maybe we can lure them out. you know any birdcalls?"," oh, tons, i'm quite the woodsman."
7151," well, maybe we can just tip the table a little."," joey, wait! the ball!"
7152, oh god! so what do we do?, i don't know. maybe we can open this up somehow.  no... it's all glued together.
7153, does that mean we have to bust it open?, i don't know. maybe.  i know! it's.. it's the foosball table.
7154," all right, you know what? we don't have a choice. it's like i would have said in that sci-fi movie if i'd gotten the part. ""those are our men in there, we have to get them out! even if i have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine.""", did that movie ever get made?
7155," (yelling) don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there."," and we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids."
7156, okay. here goes., what's the matter?
7157, i need to say goodbye to the table first., i understand.
7158," okay. table, you have given us so many great times. and you guys, jordan, victor, joel... all of you guys. what can i say? you guys make us look good. you wanna say anything?"," i don't know. except that, for one last time... (he touches the players as he says the following) good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game."
7159," okay, here we go. i can't do it."," well, i can't do it either."
7160," yeah, they're stuck inside the table!"," we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!"
7161, alright. my job here is done., that was... impressive.
7162," yeah, they were just slowing me down. alright, i have to get back to the babies. i'll see you girls later."," sorry about the table, man.  you gonna buy a new one?"
7163, probably not. nah. i don't know how much i'm gonna wanna play after you go.," well, at least we got these little guys out.  aww, we were worried about you! hm. i guess i better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?"
7164, i'm gonna miss these little guys. it was nice having birds around again.," hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you.  yeah, i mean we've got a lot going on right now. and, plus, here they'd have their own room."
7165, i could get a goose!," you know, i - i think you're set with the poultry."
7166," thanks man. did you hear that, you guys? you're gonna get to stay here! and, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit."," i think there may be another reason. so, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?"
7167," well, that's it. everything's packed."," wow, this is weird."
7168," yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.", where's ross?
7169, has it always been purple?," (to his children) look around, you guys. this was your first home. and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. but more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!"
7170," oh, honey, i forgot. i promised treeger that we'd leave our keys."," oh, okay."
7171, (crying) this is harder than i thought it would be.," oh, it's gonna be okay."
7172," okay, should we get some coffee?", sure. where?
